	<li><strong> Key terms</strong></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><strong>Global warming </strong>– the rising temperatures caused by an increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the earth’s atmosphere that captures solar radiation and retains heat in greater capacity. This has mostly been caused by anthropogenic activities, especially since industrialisation.</li>
	<li><strong>Greenhouse Gases </strong>– A gas that contributes to the greenhouse effect by absorbing infrared radiation. Carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons are examples of greenhouse gases.</li>
	<li><strong>Emissions Trading System (ETS) </strong>– The EU ETS works on the 'cap and trade' principle. A limit<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a> is set on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases (GHGs) that can be emitted by the factories, power plants and other installations in the system. The cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. Within the cap, companies receive or buy emission allowances<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a>, which they can trade with one another as needed.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a></li>
	<li><strong>Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC)</strong> – the founding principle in the Kyoto Protocol whereby more industrialised and developed countries who have historically emitted more GHGs are to be held accountable for this by having binding targets and pledging financial support to developing states. Meanwhile, developing states are not bound by any such targets since they have not historically emitted as much and this would halt their economic development or the ability to address issues associated with the development process.</li>
</ul>

<em>“Climate change does not respect borders, it does not respect who you are - rich and poor, small and big," <strong>Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations</strong></em>

&nbsp;

The threat of climate change is real. Nation-states and their representatives agree on this much. Whilst some would argue that the effects still remain uncertain, it is clear that global warming will contribute to sea-level rise, the melting of glaciers, spread of disease, food scarcity, coastal flooding and extreme weather<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></a>. These effects will have the greatest impact in the southern hemisphere but present a global obstacle to growth, human safety and the quality of life for citizens.

&nbsp;

This is not however a new phenomenon but an issue which has been heavily debated for over two decades. Global negotiations began in 1992 with the creation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the international environmental treaty. This brought climate change onto the international agenda and began setting emission reduction targets. The <strong>Kyoto Protocol</strong> of 1997, which came into action in 2005, committed parties to binding reduction targets across two periods. The first was from 2005 to 2013, with the aim of reducing emissions to 5% below 1990 levels. The second, from 2013 to 2020, set a reduction of 18%, however not all of the original parties signed on for the second period. The Kyoto Protocol also established the <strong>CBDR-RC principle.</strong> This received serious criticism on the basis that:
<ul>
	<li>climate change is a universal problem,</li>
	<li>some developing countries are major emitters,</li>
	<li>developed countries should not be held accountable for previous emissions,</li>
	<li>proactive solutions should be implemented by all.</li>
</ul>
As a result,  whilst the Kyoto Protocol was supposed to set a stricter framework for climate change prevention, it failed to actively engage all states, including many major emitters, and thus failed as a comprehensive agreement.

&nbsp;

Since then, various conferences have taken place. The core issue of these negotiations is establishing what role countries should take, understanding their various capacities to achieve targets, the impact this may have on economic and social development as well as who, historically speaking, has contributed the most to climate change. These are questions that continue to be heavily debated and often, the lack of agreement amongst states reduces the efficiency and applicability of any settlement produced.

&nbsp;

The EU has thus far set a precedent in such negotiations by producing ambitious targets, implementing the ETS and placing environmental issues high on its agenda. Having signed the Kyoto Protocol, committed to its second phase and delivered the greatest amount of overseas climate aid, the EU has undertaken significant efforts. With Lima in mind and in the lead up to Paris, the question now remains as to what role the EU should take in encouraging ambitious targets for other countries, continuing to set their own and how a universal and binding agreement can be agreed upon.

&nbsp;

	<li><strong> Key questions</strong></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>How can the EU achieve its 40% domestic emissions reduction target?</li>
	<li>What type of agreement should be sought at the Paris conference? Should it be binding, universal, non-binding or transnational?</li>
	<li>How can the EU encourage other major economies and emitters to set ambitious targets for emissions reduction?</li>
	<li>What approach should the EU take towards developing countries and the future of their environmental programmes?</li>

	<li><strong> Key actors</strong></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EU institutions:</span></em>

<strong>The European Commission </strong>in coordination with Member States is largely responsible for setting the environmental agenda and particularly enforcing it. It can appeal to the European Court of Justice against Member States who are failing to achieve their commitments. However, mostly positive incentives (such as subsidies) or expert assistance is provided to aid failing Member States. This is led by the <strong>European Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy</strong>, Miguel Arias Cañete, who represents the EU at the <strong>Conferences of Parties (COPs)</strong>. The proposals produced are also debated by the <strong>European Parliament </strong>and the <strong>Council of the European Union</strong> during the ordinary legislative procedure. In March, the <strong>European Council </strong>and heads of state will also meet to discuss the current proposals for the Paris agreement and to confirm the action plan of the EU for 2030.

&nbsp;

Since the environment is a shared competence,<strong> Member States </strong>play an important role in the decision making process towards setting goals. This means depending on their intentions and level of commitment, they may wish to alter the targets set or lobby other countries to either set more ambitious or less ambitious targets. This has been the case with the UK and renewable energies. Furthermore, where EU legislation does not provide set steps or rules, Member States can legislate as they please and adopt a variety of different policies with regard to climate change.

&nbsp;

<strong>Transnational initiatives, organisations and NGOs </strong>including Horizon 2020, the Ellen MacArthur foundation and many more are crucial for research and development as well as lobbying for change in European proposals. These can often set a precedent for new green technologies or environmentally friendly schemes. How the EU wishes to support these, consider their views or capitalise on their successes can influence the EU climate agenda which has been criticised for focusing too much on reducing GHGs and not enough on adaptation methods.

&nbsp;

<strong>The European Environmental Agency (EEA) </strong>provides information and research on environmental issues within the EU. It works in coordination with governments from Member States as well as Commission representatives and scientists. This is important in monitoring the progress of Member States, evaluating current policy and informing the public.

&nbsp;

<strong>National governments outside the EU </strong>are particularly important in reaching a binding universal agreement. The <strong>United States, India, Russia and China</strong> are major players in the negotiations as significant emitters of GHG but that is not to say that other countries do not also make a significant impact. Sharing knowledge, cooperating with and adapting to their agenda is part of the EU’s aim toward a comprehensive settlement.

&nbsp;

The <strong>United Nations </strong>is the leading body for negotiations. Any proposals to change environmental law or suggestions in the lead up to Paris will be submitted to the United Nations Environment Programme at the next COP. Any changes or new approaches accepted will be adopted under the UNFCCC (the environmental treaty of the UN).

&nbsp;
<ol start="6">
	<li><strong> Key conflicts</strong></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

The first and most basic question is whether an internationally binding agreement should be the basis for future programmes addressing climate change. Whilst the international agenda has historically attempted to do this, it has somewhat failed. The Kyoto Protocol was signed by very few and lost members during its second phase. The top three major emitters (China, the USA and India) either did not ratify the agreement or the agreement had little effect on their environment policies. Many politicians have argued that a binding agreement is simply not feasible as countries, for various reasons (economic, development, societal), do not want to commit to such an agenda. In the lead up to Paris, countries will submit their own targets based on the characteristics of their countries and their respective capabilities with regards to available resources and levels of development. However, despite the apparent progression, that does not mean that this approach guarantees ratification. As seen in previous conferences, an optimistic outlook can be undermined by severe disagreements that continue to define negotiations. Would an international agreement based on supporting transnational initiatives and non-binding agreements be more feasible? This however, would lack enforcement and considering the urgency of climate change, poses many risks to how quickly the problem can be addressed.

&nbsp;

The second issue with current negotiations is determining who is responsible for what. This discussion has dominated the debate since the introduction of CBDR-RC. To what extent are developed countries expected to shoulder the burden of climate change considering their historical emissions? Practically speaking, this translates into encouraging all countries to set ambitious targets and then implement them. For example, with the USA and China having pledged emission reductions, the EU as a leader in climate change has the opportunity to contribute to proposals made by these countries. This will require reviewing the Multilateral Assessment scheme and proposing changes, if necessary, to the INDCs.

&nbsp;

The EU’s individual contribution is another area of conflict. The current 2030 targets have been criticised for being too modest but some Member States actually fought to water down such targets<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><sup><sup>[9]</sup></sup></a>. Currently, scientists believe the aim of keeping temperature increase below 2 degrees celsius is unrealistic.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><sup><sup>[10]</sup></sup></a> The debate remains whether the EU should reconsider its GHG reduction targets.

&nbsp;

Furthermore, the target for renewables has also been considered weak as Germany, the EU’s largest economy, has already planned a large shift from nuclear to renewables<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><sup><sup>[11]</sup></sup></a>. Could this in fact be increased? If all Member States are to actively support a shift to renewables, perhaps a more ambitious target could be set. This would also avoid the free-rider problem associated with some Member States who are failing to achieve their targets. This includes 11 Member States who have fallen short of their non-ETS emission reduction targets.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><sup><sup>[12]</sup></sup></a>

&nbsp;

Another area of discussion is how the EU can support transnational initiatives such as the Horizon 2020 project or independent initiatives such as LSE cities. These are developing at fast rates and often make a significant difference on the regional and consumer level. It is uncertain how and to what extent the EU should support such initiatives and whether these could be incorporated into their targets or commitments in the international arena.

&nbsp;

Ultimately, the committee has to face disagreements with regard to the wider international agreements and the INDC submitted by the EU for the next phase of climate action.

&nbsp;
<ol start="7">
	<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">International measures</span></em>

Various <strong>COPs </strong>have occurred since the Kyoto Protocol to discuss the success of climate agreements and progress. Whilst amendments have been made and countries pledged emission reductions in the <strong>2009 Copenhagen Accord,</strong> the biggest turning point occurred in <strong>Lima, Peru </strong>in<strong> November 2014. </strong>In effect, the negotiations recognised the need for a more comprehensive and binding agreement that was not so rigidly split between developed and developing nations. Countries have now been given the chance to submit<strong> Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs)</strong> comprised of emission pledges, funding and proposals for change. These are intended to be implemented after the final phase of Kyoto. Lima also made progress in the pledging of more than 10 billion dollars by developed and developing countries to the<strong> Green Climate Fund (GCF)<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><sup><strong><sup>[13]</sup></strong></sup></a></strong>. Furthermore, the introduction of the <strong>Multilateral Assessment </strong>scheme to increase transparency and question countries about their emission targets. Furthermore, this elevated adaptation to the same level as mitigation, recognising that<strong> National Adaptation Plans (NAPs)</strong> are needed for state resilience to climate change.

&nbsp;

<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EU measures</span></em>

The EU has three climate change programmes:

The <strong>2020 Climate and Energy Package</strong> is a piece of legislation requiring the EU to achieve a 20% reduction in GHGs, a 20% increase in renewable energy sources and a 20% improvement in the EU’s energy efficiency. These goals are still to be achieved with five main policy areas: promoting green growth, developing the Emissions Trading System (ETS), annual national targets for non-ETS emissions, national renewable energy targets and carbon capture and storage. These targets are also linked to Research and Development programmes such as Horizon 2020 that enable initiatives or projects to receive support from European funds or organisations.

&nbsp;

<strong>The 2030 Framework for Climate and Energy Policies </strong>has four main goals:<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><sup><sup>[14]</sup></sup></a>
<ul>
	<li>reduce GHG emissions by 40% compared to 1990 levels.</li>
	<li>increase renewable energy by 27%</li>
	<li>increase energy efficiency by 27%</li>
	<li>reform the ETS and create a more competitive and sustainable energy economy.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>The 2050 Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe</strong> has highlighted broader aims to move to an economy mostly free from GHG emissions based on green technologies and intelligent use of energy. This incorporates expanding the green economy, resource efficiency in various sectors but with particular reference to transport, buildings and industrial production.

&nbsp;

These three programmes will have to be reviewed in order for the EU to submit its INDC before the Paris conference. The question remains, what targets should be set, how will they be implemented and could they play an active role outside of Europe?
