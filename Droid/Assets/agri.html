	<li><strong> Key terms</strong></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><strong>Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)</strong> – The role of the CAP is to provide a framework that fully supports and encourages producers to address the challenges of viable food production, sustainable management of natural resources and climate action, and balanced territorial development. It is built upon two pillars, the first one concerning the economic impact of agriculture<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> and the second one addressing the competitiveness of and social welfare in rural areas.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></li>
	<li><strong>Rural Development Policy (RDP) </strong>– This second pillar of the CAP, developed per seven year period (2007-13 and 2014-20). It especially aims at reducing the gap between more and less developed Member States when it comes to agricultural profits.</li>
	<li><strong>Single Farm Payments (SFP) </strong>– It is a system of subsidies paid to the farmers in order to boost their production and encourage them to take further steps in their rural business. The payment is assigned on per-hectar basis and not on the type of cultivated crops.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></li>
	<li><strong>Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) </strong>– Based on the SFP, the BPS allocates payments to farmers when they apply for the first year and it has to be renewed by them from the second year on. The BPS is structured in green direct payments, redistributive payments, payments for young farmers and payments for areas with natural or other constraints.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></li>
	<li><strong>Capping </strong>– The name given to the process according to which Member States are implementing the CAP and its latest reforms, especially the BPS.</li>
	<li><strong>European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development </strong>– It is the financial instrument simplifying the implementation of the RDP and managing this policy throughout its seven year duration.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></li>
	<li><strong>Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-20 </strong>– This framework regulates the EU budget and all the areas fundings should be assigned to. Therefore, it also establishes the amount of money assigned to agriculture and rural development, including the one assigned to BPS</li>
	<li><strong>Europe 2020 </strong>– A ten-year strategy aiming at a more suistainable growth of the Member States, also encourages the development of all sectors and the creation of new job opportunities.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> The increasing of sustainability and jobs in the rural production goes hand in hand with the goals set by this strategy.</li>

	<li><strong> Relevance and explanation of the issue</strong></li>
</ol>
<em> </em>

When it comes to thinking about economic development and where its basis resides, agriculture is rarely among European citizens’ thoughts. The rural sector has always had a crucial impact on the EU’s economy. Since 1957, the EU has underlined the importance of agriculture as one of the leading sectors of its economy and established the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Its main goals were increasing productivity by promoting technical progress and ensuring an availability of supplies for every citizen at reasonable prices. However, considering the great variety of farming techniques, mostly due to different climates and traditions, the EU always struggled to find a balance between the economies of its Member States, especially when it comes to protecting the producers’ interests.

&nbsp;

This has always been a very challenging issue for the EU, especially taking into account the enlargement of its borders and subsequently less homogeneous agricultural yields. On the one hand, there are more arable territories; on the other hand, new countries have different needs and often less stable conditions in terms of rural development. For example, the newMember States focus on improving their infrastructure, while the more developed ones are investing in advanced technologies that can maximise their profits. Furthermore the primary sector, encompassing mainly agriculture, decreases as industrialization increases, which puts the EU in the difficult position to keep a sector bigger than it would normally be according to market rules. These factors hinder the competitiveness of European agriculture as a whole because there does not seem to be a common way for all Member States to enhance the profits of this sector.

&nbsp;
<ol start="3">
	<li><strong> Key questions</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
	<li>How can the EU make sure that all Member States reach the RDP goals by 2020, considering the different stances of the national governments towards the new CAP?</li>
	<li>Can the Basic Payment Scheme effectively reduce the gap between the Member States when it comes to rural development and agricultural profits stability?</li>
	<li>How can the EU encourage farmers to use more environmental friendly technology that can help in working towards a more sustainable agricultural sector when it comes to both production techniques and amount of goods produced?</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ol start="4">
	<li><strong> Key facts and figures</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
	<li>The rural areas fully used for agriculture in 2012 were 174.499.000 hectars. France is the Member State with the highest output in this area.</li>
	<li>Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Poland and Portugal are the countries where more than 15% of the working population has a job in the agricultural business, while the United Kingdom, Belgium and Luxemburg have the lowest share, below 1,5%.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></li>
	<li>Denmark will apply the Basic Payments (BP) system only to some of its regions, especially on diary production, while Ireland and Italy will most likely switch to national level.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></li>
	<li>In 2010, the agricultural sector represented 0.61% of the EU’s GDP. This figure is expected to decrease to 0.33% by 2020.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></li>
	<li>The EU was the biggest exporter of agricultural products in 2013, reaching €120 billion. During the same year, the trade surplus of the EU increased by 7% and the most exported are wine, milk and cereals.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></li>
	<li>Agriculture covers 47% of the EU’s territory and up to 70% of the European species; both livestock and vegetables are unfavourably preserved or conserved, making it necessary to reduce the use of pesticides and to adopt greener and more sustainable measures.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></li>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>

<strong> </strong>
<ol start="5">
	<li><strong> Key actors</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

The EU Commission’s <strong>Directorate General (DG) for Agriculture and Rural Development</strong> aims to promote rural sector development in accordance with the goals set by Europe 2020. It promotes the implementation of the CAP to achieve viable food production, the management of natural resources and climate action as well as the balanced territorial development. The European Commission mainly focuses in the stability of the agricultural income and the necessity for the reduction of rural poverty and the growth of rural employment.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>

During the next seven years, the DG will also tackle gas emmissions and try to protect the biodiversity of the EU’s soil. The ‘greening of the CAP’ becomes, therefore, one of the most important goals to reach by 2020, also due to its connection with other EU frameworks and projects aimed at a more sustainable economic and industrial growth such as the EU Emission Trading Scheme.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>

&nbsp;

The Member States are encouraged to follow the capping process as much and as quick as possible in order to reach the goals of the RDP. However, the different economies, and the state of development and scientific research, which is lower in the south of Europe and higher in the Northern countries, makes the objectives of the RDP 2014-2020 very difficult to be fulfilled. The Member States’ goverments have the freedom to decide if they want to implement the CAP immediately at national level or to start renewating the rural sector from those regions that are more productive or better disposed to such reforms. Member States get grants if they actively engage in fostering the rural sector competitiveness, the sustainable development and in taking actions for a greener agriculture, which is also beneficial in the fight against climate change.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>
Farmers are a key target of the CAP, especially when it comes to the different BPS grants that can be allocated to them. The new CAP gives even more importance to young farmers who are willing to establish a strong enterpreneurial career in this sector. Nowadays, youngsters are faced with entry barriers, hindering both the development of food security and innovation in agriculture and the increasing of job opportunities and better social conditions in the countryside.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a> Moreover, the needs for both small and big producers lay in the different BPs that can be allocated to them as they are starting to actively fulfil the conditions the CAP is imposing as grant criteria. The farmers’ main concerns revolve around the greening aspect of the new CAP, which can strongly affect the choice of the grown crops and the final income.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>

&nbsp;

Along with climate change, economic crisis, diffused unemployment, the consumers’ needs were also taken into consideration for the lastest development of the CAP. Consumers dietary habits also changed over the years, favouring a shift towards healthier food. For this reason organic food value on the market increased in the past years; more than 70% of Europeans trust it<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a> and a they also believe it is safer due to the reduction of pesticides’ and other polluting agents’ usage.

<strong> </strong>
<ol start="6">
	<li><strong> Key conflicts</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

The implementation of the CAP at European level is very problematic due to the different stages of economic, scientific and technical development of the different EU countries as well as their social welfare.

&nbsp;

The CAP has also earned some critics from a wide number of Member States, believing that BPS slows down the economic development and hinders the majority of European countries from exporting the goods produced.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a> Sweden in particular has been the first country that took a strong position against this reform, underlining the loss of competitiveness of the European agricultural sector brought by the BPS and the damage that this may cause to smaller farms compared to the big industrialised ones. Moreover, the UK has always raised its doubts about the discrepancies in CAP funding. While France receives consistent benefits from this policy, countries such as the UK do not get the same amount of grants and their farmers perceive this as unfair.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a> Ireland is, for instance, one of the countries that will benefit the most from the new CAP since the rural land area is limited and the new reform is aimed at boosting its productivity to the maximum.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>

&nbsp;

Another issue is related to the difference between the big and small farms’ potential, as larger profits breed development. While big farms are able to implement new technologies due to their profit margin, the new CAP tends to help those smaller rural activities that can also preserve biodiversity and help with the greening strategy. However, while the former are able to invest in new methods, the latter are refrained from doing so due their higher costs and difficulty in their implementation.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>

&nbsp;
<ol start="7">
	<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

The EU established the CAP in 1957 and this policy is still the only one regulating the agriculture inside its borders. However, considering the development of modern technologies and the ever changing capacity of the Member States’ economies, a wide number of reforms have been made to keep up to date with the needs of European consumers and producers.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>

&nbsp;

In 2003 a fundamental reform of the CAP encouraged the farmers to take a more entrepreneurial view of their activities and shape them according to the market needs, raising the competitiveness of this sector in the worldwide economy. The main point of this reform consisted in introducing the Single Farm Payments (SFP), assigning subsidies to farmers according to environmental quality, food safety and animal welfare standards. Nowadays the CAP has provided every MS with the possibility to choose either to receive the SFP at a local or a regional level, increasing the flexibility of the implemented measures as well as animal welfare and environmental conditions on the territory.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>

&nbsp;

Agriculture is also present in the fundamental points of the Multiannual Financial Framework for the next seven years. Thus, the CAP will be reinforced to achieve a more modern and greener policy. This will contribute to achieve the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy,<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a> such as unlocking potential production in rural areas, developing local markets and jobs, accompanying the restructuring of agriculture and supporting farmers' income to maintain a sustainable agricultural sector throughout Europe. The most recent reform to the CAP started in 2007 and only in 2013 it was possible to reach an agreement for the future of the EU agriculture, the main target being the Rural Development of the EU agriculture.

&nbsp;

The new CAP builds on the main pillars of the old one and provides a new design for the SFP, the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS).<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a> The most important characteristic is that it is subjected to “cross compliance” <a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a> balancing the respect of environmental and animal welfare and the economies for the Member States. The BPS, which is now fully implemented, has the aim of reducing the discrepancies among the different regions of the Member States and the gap between the European countries. Moreover, a policy of “greening” is highly stressed and the European Commission is proposing to spend 30% of BP specifically to improve the use of natural resources in the soil and to support those farmers who are willing to keep up with criteria that are necessary to get this greening payment.<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a> In order to attract youngsters to the rural sector, the new Commission proposed to allocate a BP with an additional 25% for the first five years of activities to those EU citizens who are not more that forty years old and are willing to start a farming business.<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a>

&nbsp;

Last but not least the EU intends to enhance the production rate of small farms, whose role is fundamental for mantaining the biodiversity of both natural resources and products. The Rural Development Policy for 2014-2020 is based on the latest reform of the CAP and it aims at facilitating producer cooperation, reducing production costs, enhancing scientific research on new technologies and protecting the environment. The RDP encourages the Member States to build their own rural production on at least four out of six of the following targets by 2020, including the sharing of knowledge on new innovative plans for agriculture, competitiveness of the rural sector and social inclusion in the less developed areas.<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a>
