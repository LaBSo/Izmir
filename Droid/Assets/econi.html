	<li><strong> Key terms</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Tax avoidance</strong> – Technically lawful conduct, the purpose of which is to reduce or avoid tax liability</li>
	<li><strong>Tax evasion </strong>– Illegally evading the payment of a tax that is owed by law</li>
	<li><strong>Aggressive Tax Planning </strong>–Taking advantage of the technicalities of a tax system or of mismatches between two or more tax systems for the purpose of reducing tax liability<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>. Examples include:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Thin capitalisation</strong>: A means of tax avoidance whereby a subsidiary of a company will loan money from another subsidiary in order to effectively transfer profits from a nation of high taxation to that of a lower one<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Transfer pricing</strong>: the setting of charges made between related parties for goods, services, or use of intellectual property. Such pricing between the divisions of an enterprise is supposed to be set at "arm's length prices"; the price at which it would be set between unrelated parties. In practice companies can illegally misprice these transfers in order to tax sales in places with lower excises<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Immaterial rights</strong>: a form of transfer pricing often used by multi-national corporations for tax avoidance whereby they charge subsidiaries for the use of trademarks or other intellectual property<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>Tax Havens </strong>– Defined by; zero or nominal tax on the relevant income, lack of effective exchange of information, lack of transparency and no substantial economic activity<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Substantial economic activity</strong>, sometimes called ‘Genuine Business’ is disputed. Often characterized by the number of employees and the value of assets, it sometimes excludes companies that make and hold investments to combat tax avoidance.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></li>

	<li><strong> Relevance and explanation of the issue</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

<em>“The difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion is the thickness of a prison wall.” – <strong>Denis Healy, former British Chancellor of the Exchequer <a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><strong>[7]</strong></a></strong></em>

<strong> </strong>

The continued relevance of the former British chancellor’s quote highlights the importance of tax avoidance and evasion practices fifteen years on. It serves as a reminder of the everlasting nature of the problem as there will always be high incentives for rich individuals and companies to dodge taxes. With the law determining, sometimes vaguely, the legality of these practices the stakes of being caught on the wrong side of tax law remain high.

&nbsp;

The magnitude of the<strong> capital losses</strong> for the EU from tax avoidance and evasion practices, which are estimated to be <strong>€1 trillion annually</strong><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>, explains why this issue has been on top of the international agenda. Since <strong>national</strong> <strong>budgets</strong> heavily <strong>rely on taxes</strong>, this annual loss of revenue hinders Member States' ability to meet their <strong>economic and social responsibilities</strong>. This naturally affects citizens directly through different channels, including reduced policy financing and increased taxation.

&nbsp;

Discerning between tax avoidance and evasion is not always straightforward, and this is reinforced by the absence of a general tax code. For instance moving capital to offshore tax havens can be legal if the relevant tax authority is notified, or illegal otherwise. In essence, <strong>tax havens tend to attract capital inflows</strong> for different reasons including zero or very low tax rates, strict account secrecy, and political stability. At the corporation level, different mechanisms that corporations use in order to avoid taxation including <strong>thin capitalisation</strong>, <strong>transfer pricing</strong> and <strong>immaterial rights</strong>, make the distinction between legal and illegal practices even harder.

&nbsp;

In addressing these issues, there are a number of relevant factors that should be taken into account; first and foremost <strong>distinguishing</strong> between <strong>legal</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>illegal</strong> <strong>tax practices</strong>, Member States' <strong>right to fiscal sovereignty</strong>, <strong>discrepancies in tax regulations</strong> among Member States, <strong>tax havens outside the EU</strong> that cannot be influenced by EU regulation, and the <strong>right</strong> <strong>of depositors</strong> <strong>to financial privacy</strong>.

&nbsp;
<ol start="3">
	<li><strong> Key questions</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
	<li>How important is the <strong>effect</strong> of <strong>tax avoidance</strong> and <strong>evasion</strong> practices?</li>
	<li>Is <strong>Aggressive Tax Planning</strong> by individuals and corporations <strong>illegal</strong>?</li>
	<li>What are the key <strong>mechanisms</strong> that <strong>corporations</strong> use to <strong>avoid taxes</strong>? What about <strong>individuals</strong>?</li>
	<li>How realistic is for the EU to <strong>regulate taxation collectively</strong>?</li>
	<li>Which <strong>actors</strong> take part in <strong>designing tax frameworks</strong> and why do loopholes still exist?</li>
	<li>Is there a role for <strong>international actors</strong> particularly in ensuring that <strong>good practices</strong> are applied in <strong>Third-Party States</strong>, which cannot be influenced by EU regulation?</li>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>
<ol start="4">
	<li><strong> Key facts and figures</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
	<li>Tax avoidance and evasion practices are estimated to cost up to <strong>€1 trillion annually for the EU<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><strong>[9]</strong></a></strong>, and thus resulting in <strong>spillover</strong> <strong>effects</strong> <strong>on</strong> <strong>social and economic policies spending</strong></li>
	<li>At least <strong>$18.5 trillion</strong> is estimated to be <strong>hidden</strong> by individuals <strong>in worldwide tax havens</strong>, over <strong>two thirds</strong> of which are estimated to be found in <strong>EU tax havens</strong></li>
	<li>Members States’ <strong>right to fiscal sovereignty</strong> hinders the centralisation of tax governance</li>
	<li><strong>Co-operation</strong> and <strong>exchange of information</strong> regarding taxation frameworks is actively <strong>encouraged</strong> <strong>among the EU</strong> Member States</li>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>
<ol start="5">
	<li><strong> Key actors</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

The<strong> European Commission</strong>, notably its<strong> Directorate General for Taxation and Customs Union (DG TAXUD)</strong>, the <strong>European Parliament</strong> and the <strong>European Council</strong> are responsible for initiating and approving legislation respectively. The aforementioned institutions following the Ordinary Procedure essentially provide a framework in which <strong>Member States </strong>and their respective<strong> National tax authorities </strong>tailor tax policy according to domestic needs.  International efforts against tax avoidance and evasion are coordinated by international organisations, particularly the <strong>OECD</strong> and <strong>G20,</strong> making them additional key actors in this issue.

<strong> </strong>
<ol start="6">
	<li><strong> Key conflicts</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

One of the most important conflicts as discussed above is the <strong>distinction between legal and illegal accounting practices</strong> to avoid taxation. This is particularly complex at the corporate level because of the different and often complex mechanisms used to avoid taxation, but it naturally remains the case at the individual level.

&nbsp;

Another important conflict in this topic is the <strong>need for access to information by tax authorities</strong>, particularly when third-party states are involved, and the <strong>right of depositors to financial privacy</strong>. Lastly the <strong>right of Member States to fiscal sovereignty</strong> often conflicts with the <strong>need for coordinated action</strong> at the European Union level.

<strong> </strong>
<ol start="7">
	<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

There have been efforts at both the <strong>European</strong> and the <strong>international level</strong> to combat tax avoidance and evasion. Focusing on the former, the EU essentially provides arrangements within which Member States have to coordinate policy according to domestic needs. The EU has developed a <strong>comprehensive toolbox</strong> to improve the ability of Member States <strong>to fight tax avoidance and tax evasion</strong>, including improved transparency, exchange of information, administrative cooperation, coordinated actions on aggressive tax planning and tax havens, and other country specific recommendations<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>.

&nbsp;

In particular, the <strong>EU Savings Tax Directive</strong> that is in force since 2005 lays down the principle of automatic exchange of information. Following its first review, the European Commission adopted an <strong>amending proposal</strong> in November 2008, aiming to close existing loopholes and better prevent tax evasion. This revised edition of the EU Savings Tax Directive was adopted by the Council of Ministers in March 2014.

&nbsp;

The European Commission's <strong>Action Plan to further strengthen the fight against evasion and avoidance</strong> (December 2012) includes measures covering individuals, companies and uncooperative jurisdictions. It supports the development of the existing good governance policy, the wider issues of <strong>interaction with tax havens</strong> and of <strong>tackling aggressive tax planning</strong> and further aspects, including tax-related crimes.

&nbsp;

Further measures include the <strong>Directive on mutual assistance for the recovery of taxes</strong>, which is in force since 2010, the <strong>VAT Reverse Charge Directive</strong> proposed by the Commission in 2009, the <strong>Regulation on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT</strong> which has been in force since 2012 and the <strong>Quick Reaction Mechanism</strong> <strong>to fight VAT fraud</strong> which was proposed by the Commission in July 2012.

&nbsp;

Apart from the improvement of tax collection within each Member States and the increased cooperation across Member States as outlined above, the EU has taken steps towards a coherent policy vis-à-vis <strong>third countries</strong> in order to promote its <strong>standards of good governance in tax matters</strong>.
