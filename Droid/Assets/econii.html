<ol>
	<li><strong> Key terms</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Micro, small and medium enterprises (SMEs)</strong> – SMEs are enterprises with fewer than 250 employees and which have an annual turnover under €50 million or a balance sheet under €43 million. Micro enterprises employ fewer than 10 people, small enterprises fewer than 50 and medium enterprises fewer than 250.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></li>
	<li><strong>Capital markets </strong>– Financial markets for buying and selling long-term assets such as equity and debt securities. Capital markets make capital suppliers (investors) meet capital users (businesses, governments or individuals). See the explanatory video on Investopedia: [<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/video/play/capital-markets/">LINK</a>]</li>
	<li><strong>Equity securities </strong>– Ownership share in a company. <strong>Private equity</strong> refers to investors directly buying shares in companies that are not listed on the stock exchange, hoping to make a profit on the long term by reselling their shares when the company becomes sustainable or when it enters the stock market. Watch the EVCA’s video explaining private equity: [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92czZAI2RP8">LINK</a>]</li>
	<li><strong>Debt securities </strong>– Money borrowed by a government or a corporation at a fixed amount and term (‘maturity date’), and at a specific interest rate.</li>
	<li><strong>Mezzanine financing </strong>– A hybrid financing model combining debt and equity financing. The company starts with a loan which, if not paid back in full and in time, will be converted in equity securities. See the explanatory video on Investopedia: [<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/video/play/mezzanine-financing/">LINK</a>]</li>
	<li><strong>Venture capitalists </strong>– Investors providing funds for small businesses and startups that are expected to experience large growth on the long term. See the explanatory video on Investopedia: [<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/video/play/venture-capital/">LINK</a>]</li>
	<li><strong>Business angels </strong>(also<strong> angel investors</strong>) – Private individuals who invest their personal assets in new businesses, often offering more favourable conditions than venture capitalists. Have a look what makes the difference between a business angel and a venture capitalist: [<a href="http://www.thebusinessangel.org/difference-businessangel-venturecapital.html">LINK</a>]</li>
	<li><strong>Crowdfunding </strong>– Fundraising small amounts of money from a large number of individuals without intermediaries, often using social networks, with the goal to draw investors’ attention.</li>
</ul>

	<li><strong> Relevance and explanation of the issue</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

<em>“The euro area economy is like a plane flying on only one engine: bank financing. To increase the speed and stability of the plane, it would be good to add a second engine: capital market financing.” –</em> <strong><em>Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank</em></strong>

<strong> </strong>

SMEs are often described as the ‘backbone’ or ‘lifeblood’ of European economy. As a matter of fact, the soundness of our economies largely rests upon them: SMEs create jobs, support economic growth and are an immense reservoir of innovative capacity. However, like any large business, an SME cannot function without money. 80% of European SMEs’ funds come from the banking system, compared to only 50% in the United States.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> The dependence of European SMEs on bank loans has become problematic since the beginning of the economic and financial crisis. Banks are reluctant to invest and consequentially SMEs applying for bank loans face more rejections, receive less than desired, or have to pay substantial interest rates.

&nbsp;

Subsequently, the EU and its Member States have taken measures and designed mechanisms to make it easier for SMEs to get bank loans by offering guarantees and minimising risks for banks. There is now a need to equip SMEs with tools to diversify their sources of funding and in particular to secure funding on capital markets. Yet problems remain. High risks and the difficulty of assessing especially SMEs’ risks deter potential investors, while the cost of raising funds and lack of knowledge prevent entrepreneurs from entering capital markets.

&nbsp;
<ol start="3">
	<li><strong> Key questions</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
	<li>What are the advantages and disadvantages of public (e.g. EU funding programmes) and market-based (e.g. private equity) funding strategies?</li>
	<li>How are SMEs of different sizes, locations and sectors affected by funding issues? What branches are already taken care of?</li>
	<li>Which financing strategies are the most sustainable and applicable to a large proportion of European SMEs?</li>
	<li>Do SMEs of different sizes, at different development stages, based in different countries and operating in different sectors, have the same financing needs. Can they access the same sources?<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></li>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>
<ol start="4">
	<li><strong> Key facts and figures</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
	<li>99% of European firms are SMEs, accounting for 21.6 million enterprises in 2014. That same year European SMEs employed 88.8 million people, which represent 2 out of 3 jobs in the private sector, and contributed to 58% (€3,666 trillion) of the value added created in the EU.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> 91% of European enterprises are micro-enterprises.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></li>
	<li>SMEs go through four development stages: seed, start-up, early growth and sustained growth, which influence their financing needs.</li>
	<li>15% of European SMEs say that their main concern is raising funds.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></li>
	<li>62% of European SMEs prefer bank loans to finance their activities; 7% only prefer equity investment. Bank loans are most used in Belgium, France (73%) and Portugal (71%), while equity is most popular in Sweden (27%), Croatia (23%) and Greece (21%).<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> However these preferences are homogenous across sectors, sizes and innovativeness, with 59 to 67% of SMEs preferring bank loans and 5 to 9% preferring equity.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></li>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>
<ol start="5">
	<li><strong> Key actors</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

Mostly concerned by the issue are of course <strong>SMEs</strong> that have to decide on their financing strategies. <strong>Individuals</strong> are key in SME financing, firstly because over 90% of European SMEs have less than 10 employees and are run by a small number of people, and secondly because SMEs can raise funds from individual investors such as business angels, or by mobilising their personal networks for crowdfunding.

&nbsp;

Public institutions both at national and EU level can nudge SMEs in the direction of capital markets. The EU institutions, among which mostly the <strong>European Commission</strong> (EC) and its Directorate-General (DG) for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, design EU funding programmes and the priorities of their investment. The Commission also designates the EU SME envoy, whose task it is to promote SMEs’ interests in the Commission’s work. The European Investment Fund (<strong>EIF</strong>) has the specific task of helping European SMEs access finance. <strong>National governments</strong> take measures to support SMEs in their respective territories and might be in a better position to act on the national capital markets

<strong> </strong>

At the EU level, the interests of 12 million SMEs employing 55 million people are represented by the <strong>European Association of Craft, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises</strong> (UEAPME). Finally, stakeholders are gathered in associations such as the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), the European Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (EVCA), the European Trade Association for Business Angels (EBAN), Seed Funds and Early Stage Market Players, Business Angels Europe (BAE), the European Crowdfunding Network (ECN), and the European Business and Innovation Centre Network (EBN).

<strong> </strong>
<ol start="6">
	<li><strong> Key conflicts</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

The first issue to contemplate is the <strong>type of measure</strong>. A country can decide to offer <strong>public incentives</strong> to develop equity finance: for instance the UK has a Venture Capital Trust Scheme which is based on tax reductions for individuals who invest in high-risk SMEs; Germany has the ERP Startup Fund, which operates on the basis of co-investment with the private sector in young technology-based firms; France has two investment funds that aim to facilitate equity. On the other hand, <strong>private operators</strong> can also trigger change in financing habits: the AIM is a stock exchange for small companies in the UK; NYSE Alternext in France is designed to attract SMEs and allow them to go public. The efficiency and sustainability of both types of measures need to be studied.

&nbsp;

A different debate could focus on the <strong>targets of the measures</strong>. Action can be taken either on SMEs or on the markets. If one chooses to <strong>target SMEs</strong>, consideration should be given to improving the transparency of their business strategies and their creditworthiness,<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> in order to provide investors with more information about the kind of risks they are taking. Contrary to large firms, SMEs’ business strategies, organisational structure or the contracts they sign, are rarely made public, or SMEs might have an interest in keeping their strategy private in their early stages of development.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a> As for the <strong>markets</strong>, several things need be addressed. One could reduce legal, accounting and marketing costs for SMEs; develop alternative capital markets specifically tailored to SMEs’ needs<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>. Other options include striving for more general and lasting measures aiming to create an SME-friendly ecosystem and to provide more flexibility and options, for example through funding escalators that offer adapted types of finance depending on the SME’s development stage.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>

&nbsp;
<ol start="7">
	<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

At the EU level, a large number of measures target SMEs and SME funding. First of all, the EU passed a <strong>Small Business Act for Europe</strong> in 2008, aiming to create an SME-friendly environment based on a ‘Think Small First’ principle and to ‘<em>tackle the remaining problems which hamper their development.</em>’<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>

&nbsp;

In this spirit, the EU has increasingly taken measures specifically targeting SMEs. These targeted measures are coordinated by the Executive Agency for SMEs (EASME). The main part of these measures are the financial instruments of <strong>COSME</strong><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>. The COSME pillar for better access to finance for SMEs establishes an Equity Facility for Growth (EFG)<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a> supporting venture capital and mezzanine finance solutions for SMEs. EASME also manages SME instruments in the field of research and innovation: the funding programme ‘Horizon 2020’ offers an instrument for <strong>access to risk finance</strong> for highly innovative firms that supports equity finance in the early stages of an SME’s life.

&nbsp;

Besides help for accessing new finance instruments, the EU provides SMEs with <strong>information and support services</strong>. It has set up the locally-based Enterprise Europe Network (EEN) to help SMEs identify and reach investors, venture capitals and public funds. The business portal ‘Your Europe’ centralises information on a wide range of topics, from customs to funding and environmental issues, while the European Small Business Portal is conceived specifically for SMEs.

&nbsp;

SMEs are also included in larger EU programmes, such as the recent Investment Plan for Europe and the upcoming Capital Markets Union.  The <strong>Investment Plan for Europe</strong>, launched in November 2014 by the EC and the European Investment Bank (EIB), aims at mobilising €315 billion over the next 3 years, including €75bn that should go to SMEs and mid-cap companies (up to 3000 employees). However, the plan has yet to prove successful since it rests on the EU’s ability to mobilise private investors.

&nbsp;

Initially suggested in October 2014, Jean-Claude Juncker, the Commission president, has put the idea of a <strong>Capital Markets Union</strong> (CMU) back on the table to support the Investment Plan. The Commission announced in January 2015 that it would start making plans to set up the CMU. The idea behind it is to remove barriers between national capital markets in the EU, which would, in effect, make the European system more similar to the United States, where funding is widely provided by the markets. The CMU should make it easier for investors to go international and access data, less costly for firms to seek funds on capital markets, and offer more choice and opportunities for all stakeholders.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>

&nbsp;

Finally, the EU <strong>monitors SMEs’ access to finance</strong> through the SME access to finance (SMAF) index which maps developments and differences across countries in access to debt and equity finance. The Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB) lead an annual survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE). The EU also communicates with SMEs about best practices and available financial instruments by organising meetings (‘EU Access to Finance Days’) in all member states.

&nbsp;

The <strong>European Investment Fund</strong> has a particular role within the EU to support SME finance. The EIF has set up a large variety of tools to support equity, such as the European Angels Fund (EAF), the Social Impact Accelerator (SIA) for social enterprises, and the Mezzanine Facility for Growth. Finally, the EIF is present at the local level through a series of regional and sectorial initiatives, which you can check <a href="http://www.eif.org/what_we_do/resources/funds_of_funds/index.htm">here</a>.

&nbsp;

Measures taken by <strong>national governments</strong> vary from country to country. The general trend goes towards bank-oriented solutions, while less than half of the EU member states have offered solutions to promote venture capital, equity funding or business angel support.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a> Public support for equity can be either direct (e.g. investment in venture capital funds) or indirect (e.g. tax incentives): the UK grants a tax relief up to £100,000 to individuals who invest in early-stage SMEs for at least 3 years, while France has set up a strategic investment fund that invests in venture capital funds which themselves invest in SMEs.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a> The European Commission has published <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/finance/guide-to-funding/indirect-funding/index_en.htm#h2-2">country factsheets</a> giving an overview of the measures implemented in each EU member state.
