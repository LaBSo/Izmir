	<li><strong>Copenhagen Criteria</strong> – A country willing to join the European Union (EU) has to first meet the key criteria for accession, also referred to as ‘Copenhagen criteria’. These criteria involve:
<ul>
	<li>stable institutions guaranteeing the basic values of the EU<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>;</li>
	<li>a functioning and competitive market economy;</li>
	<li>adaption of the domestic administrative and judicial system to the so-called <em>acquis communautaire</em>, meaning the collective body of EU legislation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>Chapter </strong>– The EU’s approximately 80.000 pages long <em>acquis communautaire</em> consists of 35 chapters, each dealing with rules and regulations of a particular policy field.</li>

<em>“The Turks have only ever gone in one direction -- towards the West.”– <strong>Mustafa Kemal Atatürk</strong></em>

<em> </em>

Regarding the current state of play in the accession negotiations between Turkey and the EU, the European Commission’s latest Progress Report on Turkey, published in October 2014, gave a rather ambivalent summary of the negotiation’s status quo. Despite some important steps forward over the past twelve months such as the signature and entry into force of the EU-Turkey Readmission Agreement (cf. section 7) or the continuous efforts to settle the Kurdish question, the report’s tenor was characterised by various concerns. These relate amongst others “to the adoption of the legislation undermining the independence, efficiency and impartiality of the judiciary [...] [or] blanket bans imposed on social media.” <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> The analysis’ result mirrors the ongoing stagnation of the accession negotiations between Turkey and the European Union since its beginning in 2005.

&nbsp;

Although the start of Turkish-European relations in the way we know it date back to the 1960s, Turkey officially applied for membership in 1987 and was granted the status of candidate country by the European Council in 1999.

A few years later the Council concluded that accession negotiations could be opened as of October 2005. <a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> Since then one chapter of the acquis communautaire, Science and Research, has been provisionally closed, whilst another fourteen have been opened. However, due to the Cyprus question (cf. section 7) eight chapters cannot be opened and none provisionally closed until this matter is settled.

&nbsp;

How is it that this accession process is coined by toing and froing? Apart from Turkey’s efforts to fulfil the Copenhagen Criteria, its membership request has opened a general debate on the country’s affiliation to the EU. For a deeper understanding, this debate can be divided into three main subjects: politics, economy and identity.

&nbsp;

Member States opposed to the accession of Turkey emphasise cultural differences (cf. Section 6). They note that never in the EU’s enlargement history has a Muslim-majority population been integrated into the Union. Hence the cultural implications on both sides are hard to predict, let alone the amount of seats in the European Parliament Turkey would be entitled to, given its population of about 76 million people.

&nbsp;

Economic concerns relate to the potential influx of Turkish work-seekers in the EU’s labour market given the current high rate of unemployment in several Member States, and other questions about Turkey’s long-term economic stability.
Regarding the political sphere, the Turkish government aroused serious criticism for its repressive treatment of protesters during the course of the Gezi Park and Taksim Square protests and allegations of corruption in 2013. In addition to this, an Internal Security Bill proposed by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) caused some anxiety both within the parliament and the civil society in Turkey, as well as in Member States. Despite concerns raised over the provisions that prevent the exercise of the democratic rights to protest and to organise, and further expand the police’s ability to tackle public demonstrations and broaden their scope to use firearms against protesters<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></a>, and after much controversy, the bill was passed in the Turkish Grand National Assembly in late February 2015.

&nbsp;

In a nutshell, it can be said that the accession process has lost its momentum. Besides, as regular Europe-wide polls have shown, there is a decline in support for the membership on the part of both the EU’s and Turkey’s population. However, as far as the two parties are concerned it is out of the question that Turkey is and needs to be affiliated to the EU. Thus, it is to clarify how EU-Turkey relations can be refined for mutual benefit.

&nbsp;
<ol start="3">
	<li><strong> Key questions</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
	<li>Does the EU still consider Turkey to be a future member or rather a neighbour with a special relationship?
<ul>
	<li>What would a special relationship look like?</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>If the EU still is supportive of the candidature, how can it convince and support the Turkish authorities to initiate and implement the necessary reforms?</li>
	<li>How can the EU address issues such as the Kurdish conflict, the Cyprus question and the Armenian genocide?</li>
	<li>Does the EU face the limits of its integration capacity or does it suffer from enlargement fatigue?</li>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>
<ol start="4">
	<li><strong> Key facts and figures</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
	<li>The EU is Turkey’s largest trading partner, while Turkey is the EU’s sixth largest. <a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></li>
	<li>Turkey is the world’s 16th largest economy.</li>
	<li>Turkey’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita amounts to only half of EU-average. <a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></li>
	<li>In 2014 Turkey was ranked 64 out of 175 countries in the Corruption Perception Index of Transparency International 2014 (rank 58 in 2008).<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></li>
	<li>Turkey has a 10% threshold in parliamentary elections.</li>
	<li>The World Press Freedom Index assigned rank 154 out of 180 to Turkey (rank 98/161 in 2005).<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></li>
	<li>Turkey is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) since 1952, having the alliance’s second largest army at command, and an ally with Israel and the United States.</li>
	<li>Turkey is neighbour to two Member States on the west; Greece and Bulgaria. Additionally, it also shares borders with Syria, Iraq, Iran and Georgia and one closed border with Armenia.</li>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>
<ol start="5">
	<li><strong> Key actors</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

Regarding Turkey’s candidature, a great amount of actors are involved in the accession process. On the one hand there is the <strong>Turkish government</strong>, represented by the former Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who became the first directly elected President last August, and his successor in office, new Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu. Erdoğan declared in his inauguration speech that the accession negotiations remain a strategic target for Turkey. Both politicians belong to the Justice and Development Party (AKP) that came into power in 2002 and ever since initiated eight reform packages, e.g. the ban on death penalty and torture.

&nbsp;

On the other hand there are the European institutions with the <strong>European Commission</strong> leading the way. The Commission, embodied by Johannes Hahn, the Austrian Commissioner responsible for enlargement and European neighbourhood policy and Federice Mogherini, the High Representative for Foreign Affairs, accounts for the conduct, monitoring and evaluation of the accession negotiations. Amongst others it carries out the initial screening, presents the annual progress reports and facilitates the dialogue between the candidate country and Member States by means of bilateral meetings.

&nbsp;

The <strong>European Parliament</strong> has a rather advisory role in the negotiations. However, once the talks are completed the EP has to give its assent to conclude the accession process. In order to involve the only directly legitimised institution from the very beginning <strong>Joint Parliamentary Committees</strong> (JPC) for each candidate country have been established. Composed of an equal number of Members of the Turkish Grand National Assembly and of the European Parliament, the EU-Turkey JPC meets twice a year discussing the progress and obstacles faced during the negotiations.

&nbsp;

<strong>Member States’</strong> support for a candidate country is decisive for the negotiations’ success. Only after the approval of all 28 national parliaments, followed by an unanimous vote and the signature of the final treaty will the candidate ultimately be able to join the EU.

&nbsp;
<ol start="6">
	<li><strong> Key conflicts</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

The central conflict the Committee on Constitutional Affairs I has to deal with is the question of whether Turkey is considered to be a <strong>member or a neighbour</strong> of the European Union and how this shapes the current and future EU-Turkey relations. There are several other conflicts that derive from this controversy.

&nbsp;

One is the continuous disagreement between the Member States regarding their support or opposition to the Turkish accession. Despite Turkey’s readiness to start further accession negotiations on particular chapters, stagnation prevails. The progress report 2014 states: “Of a total of 33 reports, nine are pending in the Council. Work on a number of negotiating chapters has been interrupted over the years, due to lack of consensus among Member States.”<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> However, this consensus is crucial for the final vote on the Turkish accession after the negotiations are closed, for it has to be unanimous to grant membership to a candidate.

&nbsp;

At the European level, one must bear in mind that the domestic situations in each Member State potentially differ. Countries such as France, Greece and Germany are known to oppose to Turkey’s accession. They favour alternate forms of affiliation: one being the already created Union for the Mediterranean as proposed by former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, another being a privileged partnership as suggested by the German government in 2004. Countries, which express their support for the membership request, are amongst others Poland, United Kingdom and Sweden.

&nbsp;

These diverging stances are due to a second conflict – the question whether Turkey is compatible with European values or not. Opponents sometimes refer to a “clash of civilisations”, meaning that both Turkish society and culture do not go hand in hand with the liberal-democratic values such as democracy, rule of law, respect of minorities and protection of human rights that the EU promotes. In order to support their claim they refer to the Kurdish issue, the unresolved Cyprus dispute and the non-recognition of the Armenian genocide by the Turkish government. In addition to this, the recent adoption of legislation limiting the freedom of expression, such as the Criminal Code or the Anti-Terror Law, the blanket ban on Social Media and the police raids on leading newspapers and TV stations in 2014, raised concern among Member States. The High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Federica Mogherini, and Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn described these raids as “incompatible with the freedom of media, which is a core principle of democracy.” <a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a> They further stated: “We recall that any further step towards accession with any candidate country depends on the full respect for the rule of law and fundamental rights.” <a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>

&nbsp;
<ol start="7">
	<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

The lengthy accession proceedings go along with diverse treaties and measures established to answer the question how Turkey should be related to the EU. In 1963 European Economic Community (EEC), the predecessor of the EU, established a treaty-based relation with Turkey by signing the <strong>Ankara Association Agreement</strong><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>. This laid the foundation for the following economic cooperation and the progressive formation of a custom union, which was formed in 1995. Article 28 of the agreement pointed out the prospect of an accession: “As soon as the operation of this Agreement has advanced far enough [...] the Contracting Parties shall examine the possibility of the accession of Turkey to the Community.”<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a> However, after the EU enlargement in 2004, the <strong>Additional Protocol</strong>, which had supplemented the Ankara agreement since 1970, needed to be expanded in order to incorporate the new Member States into the custom union. Consequently, Turkey declared its continuing non-recognition of the Republic of Cyprus. Despite the EU rejection of this declaration, Cyprus has not been granted the right of free movement of goods on Turkish territory to the present day. This treaty violation caused the Council of the EU in 2006 to partially suspend the accession negotiations. Henceforth, eight relevant chapters<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a> will remain unopened and none will be closed until Turkey implements the Additional Protocol without any exceptions.

&nbsp;

In order to resolve the Cyprus question the EU has launched an <strong>aid programme for the Turkish-Cypriot community</strong> in 2006. The programme’s purpose is mainly the promotion of civil society and confidence-building to encourage dialogue between the Turkish-Cypriot community and the EU.

&nbsp;

Being an accession candidate entitles Turkey to receive funding from the <strong>Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA)</strong>. The IPA serves as the EU’s financial and technical support for candidate countries providing them with the necessary capacity for reforms and development. For the 2007-2013 period Turkey could call on a total of about 4.9 billion euros. The successor programme IPA II could liquidate assets of around 2.6 billion euros for the 2014-2017 period. The Commission and Turkey modified IPA II’s framework and priorities as set out in the <strong>Indicative Strategy Paper for Turkey</strong> for the period 2014-2020<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>.

&nbsp;

Furthermore, the EU and Turkey started negotiating a <strong>Readmission agreement </strong>in 2011, which aims to establish procedures and obligations between the two contracting parties that facilitate the readmission of persons illegally residing or having entered their territory. In December 2013 the Turkish Parliament ratified the agreement and took an “important step to a visa-free regime for Turks travelling to the EU”<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>, as the former Commissioner for Enlargement Stefan Füle said. Namely because the EU in return started visa liberalisation talks with Turkey. The objective of these talks is the elimination of the visa obligation currently imposed on Turkish citizens.

<strong> </strong>

In order to bring new momentum to the accession process, the European Commission in collaboration with Turkish authorities and civil society representatives launched the so-called <strong>Positive Agenda </strong>in 2012.

&nbsp;

This unheard-of innovative enlargement policy technique is meant to be a complement to the accession process. It is supposed to rebuild confidence in the EU-Turkey relations and increase public support. The initiative sets up eight working groups, each composed of both Eurocrats and Turkish bureaucrats and allocated to a specific chapter, that aim to advance the harmonisation of Turkish law with EU legislation by means of a technical dialogue. Among these chapters are “Judiciary and Fundamental Rights” as well as “Justice, Freedom and Security”.

<strong> </strong>

In addition to the afore mentioned measures, it is important to also point to the new <strong>European Union Strategy </strong>the newly elected Turkish government mapped out in 2014. It outlines how Turkey intends to revive the domestic reform process and improve its communication with the EU. Amongst others it focuses on enhancing the implementation capacity of legal adjustments and refines the concrete measures necessary for the closure of each negotiation chapter.
