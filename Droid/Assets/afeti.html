	<li><strong> Key terms</strong></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><strong>Crimea </strong>– The Crimean peninsula at the south of Ukraine, on the Black Sea coast, became the centre of the territorial dispute between Russia and Ukraine in February 2014. Crimea’s sovereignty became a key question in the Ukraine crisis as the Russian-backed forces seized control of the peninsula. This was followed by the territory’s large Russian speaking majority voting in a referendum to join Russia on the 16<sup>th</sup> of March; 97% reportedly voted in favour<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>. This figure was later disputed, and more recent estimates suggest that only 50-60% supported the move. The referendum was deemed illegal by Ukraine and most of the international community. Crimea is seen as the focal point of the crisis, together with the Eastern Ukraine where the fighting continues.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><strong>Minsk Agreement </strong>– A ceasefire agreement signed by Ukraine and pro-Russian separatist rebels on the 5th of September 2014, in Minsk, Belarus. The agreement contained 12 points, including but not limited to pulling back heavy guns by at least 15km, allowing international observers and releasing prisoners. However this did not result putting an end to the military clashes in the area, and the accusations from both sides about the violation of the ceasefire continues. The Agreement was proclaimed a failure as it did not manage to establish a lasting ceasefire between the two parties.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><strong>Euromaiden </strong>– Refers to a period of civic unrest and series of demonstrations which began on the 21st of November 2013, where the public expressed its dissatisfaction about the Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and his parliament, following Yanukovych’s refusal to sign the Association Agreement which would had resulted in closer ties between Ukraine and the European Union. The name refers to the hopes for further European integration many people had, as well as Independence Square in the Ukrainian capital in Kyiv where most of the demonstrations took place.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><strong>Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)</strong> – the world’s largest security oriented intergovernmental organisation. Established during the Cold War era to create a forum for East-West dialogue, though nowadays criticised for concentrating more on election monitoring rather than conflict prevention and crisis management.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><strong>The European Security Strategy </strong>– adopted by the European Council in December 2003, laying down its strategic objectives, identifying key security challenges and the political implications those were to have for the EU.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><strong>EUBAM – </strong>EU border monitoring mission, currently largely responsible for controlling traffic on borders of Ukraine and Moldova. Originally introduced to improve the border monitoring standards to be compatible with those of the Union, as well as to help with conflict resolution on said borders.</li>
</ul>

<em>“Ukraine's sovereign territory must be respected and the Ukrainian people must be free to determine their own future” - </em>Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>, March 2014

&nbsp;

Ukraine is going through the most serious and damaging crisis in decades; what originally started as an uprising following the Ukrainian government’s refusal to foster closer ties with the EU, has now grown into a country wide conflict with a strong international dimension. The country is struggling at the brink of a civil war with a significant pressure both internally, with the Eastern region facing increased isolation in the hands of the pro-Russian rebels, and outside, with Russia supplying the rebel troops and strengthening its sanctions on imports from Ukraine.

&nbsp;

In addition to the severe internal divides, Ukraine has also seen increasing pressure from the Russian side. The Crimean Peninsula has taken the central stage in the conflict: Since Ukraine is seeking closer ties with the Union, this provoked Russia to annex the Crimea Peninsula and pro-Russian rebels in the east seek to establish full control over the Eastern region. During spring 2014, the separatists backed by the pro-Russian troops took over the most important cities of the Eastern counties, namely Luhansk and Donetsk. The news is filled with pictures of “green men”, referring to armed soldiers wearing uniforms very similar to that of the Russian army while Russia continues to deny having sent troops and to be supplying the rebels.

&nbsp;

The crisis in Ukraine has not only been widely discussed in the international community - it has also prompted a variety of international actors to take action. Many heads of the Member States have been involved in the negotiations for ceasefire. February 2015 saw yet another diplomatic push in order to end the fighting, the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France announcing that the ceasefire will begin on 15<sup>th</sup> of February. However, since the Agreement failed, earlier ceasefire brought upon by the Minsk Agreement generated concerns about this new ceasefire attempt.

&nbsp;
<ol start="3">
	<li><strong> Key questions</strong></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>What role should the EU play in the Ukraine crisis, with a view to offering support and assistance to Ukraine whilst respecting its sovereignty?</li>
	<li>What action has the EU taken so far in the context of the crisis in Ukraine and/or in order to support Ukraine?</li>
	<li>Should the EU pursue a more unified foreign policy approach instead of many leaders of the Member States being active in the peace negotiations? What would this entail in practice?</li>
	<li>Who should be taking the front seat on the EU’s side in endeavours to bring back peace and stability to Ukraine – the High Representative or the heads of the Member States?</li>
	<li>Considering the poor success of two consecutive ceasefires, what should be the way forward?</li>
	<li>How should the EU revise its security strategy to allow for more coherent and effective European responses in crisis situations?</li>
	<li>Should the EU continue putting pressure on Russia in the form of sanctions or pursue an alternative path?</li>
	<li>How should the EU-Russia relations be further developed in order to help solve the conflict, whilst maintaining the values the Union upholds?</li>
</ul>

	<li><strong> Key facts and figures</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

According to the Global Militarisation Index 2014<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>, Ukraine rose from 20<sup>th</sup> to the 13<sup>th</sup> place among the most militarised countries in the world, with its military spending amounting to 5.3 billion dollars representing 3% of national GDP.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>

&nbsp;

The crisis in Ukraine has already claimed more than 5300 lives and internally displaced 1.5 million people from their homes.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>

&nbsp;

The March 16<sup>th</sup> referendum in Crimea had an official election outcome of 95.5% of voters supporting joining Russia, even though condemned fraudulent by the EU and the US.

&nbsp;

Some 58% of the people in Crimea are ethnic Russians, the rest of the local population is comprised of Ukrainians and Tatars.

&nbsp;

The current international status of Crimea and Sevastopol are only recognised by five UN Member States.

&nbsp;
<ol start="5">
	<li><strong> Key actors</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

<strong>Ukraine – </strong>The location of the crisis and the main actor involved: Ukraine is aiming to balance out not only the internal divisions but also the foreign policy power play further fuelling the crisis. The crisis is viewed and portrayed in the media as a continuation of the East-West divide stemming from the Cold War is largely harmful for Ukraine’s attempts to self-determination and finding a balance in its difficult situation.

&nbsp;

<strong>European institutions</strong> – Federica Mogherini as <strong>the High Representative</strong> is meant to be the face of EU foreign policy making.  She is responsible for the link between the <strong>External Action Service (EEAS) </strong>and the European Commission, aspiring to ensure harmony between the two. <strong>The EU Foreign Policy instruments (FPI)</strong>, manage foreign policy issues within the European Commission mandate, running various foreign policy actions (such as CFSP, Eastern Partnership and sanctions). <strong> </strong>

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Member States – </strong>Several heads of the Member States have taken an active role in the peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, most notably France and Germany<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>.

&nbsp;

<strong>Russia </strong>– has taken a very prominent role in the Ukrainian crisis – both through its direct dealing with Ukraine but also in its response to the international community and their help to Ukraine. Lead by its president Vladimir Putin, Russia has not only put brakes on Ukraine’s attempts to foster closer ties with the European Union, but it has also denied to be supporting the separatists holding Crimea and Eastern Ukraine under their power.

&nbsp;

<strong>International community</strong> – The eyes of the international community are largely concentrated on Ukraine, with hopes of finding a viable solution to the crisis. The US supports the idea of giving defensive but not offensive weapons: they have so far refrained from supplying Ukraine with lethal weaponry, but according to US President Barack Obama this option remains on the table<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>:

&nbsp;

<strong>NATO</strong> – Ukraine is not a member of NATO, but considering its geographic closeness to countries such as the Baltic States, NATO is keeping a close eye on the developments in the area. Furthermore, NATO has increased its military presence in the surrounding countries following the increase of Russian military presence in Eastern Ukraine.

&nbsp;
<ol start="6">
	<li><strong> Key conflicts</strong></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<strong>Ukraine - Russia relations:</strong> Russia shows clear signals of disapproval of Ukraine seeking closer ties with the EU: on September 12<sup>th</sup>, Russia put brakes on EU and Ukraine trade negotiations resulting in the EU and Ukraine postponing their free-trade agreement to 2016 in exchange for Russia not issuing a trade embargo on Ukraine. However these developments do not contribute to stabilising Ukraine, as Russia’s reply to the sanctions imposed by the EU has included freezing fruit and vegetable imports from Ukraine, claiming “health concerns”.

&nbsp;

<strong>Russia - EU relations:</strong> Russia’s repeated violation of the sovereignty of the Ukrainian state and its contribution to the increase of violence in the area has prompted the EU to take action against Russia. This has happened, most prominently, in the form of sanctions, with the latest ones being introduced on the 30<sup>th</sup> of January 2015. At the same time, many EU Member States are dependent on the energy imported from Russia (about a quarter of Europe’s gas comes from Russia<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>) and many fear that the sanctions harming Russian economy could potentially create backlash in the form of disruption in the energy supply or in the form of counter sanctions imposed by Russia on EU food imports (as already is the case with Ukraine). Therefore, there are significant disagreements within the Member States about the extent that the Union should get involved in supporting Ukraine, as so far that has meant taking action against Russia.

&nbsp;

<strong>Ukraine - EU relations:</strong> The protests following the refusal of the Ukrainian government to sign the Association Agreement in the Vilnius summit showed the pro-European sentiment present in Ukraine, however the population is also largely divided over this question. Two years into the crisis and no end in sight, Ukrainians show signs of discontent about the way the EU has handled their side of the talks: The failure of the Minsk agreement and OSCE border monitoring following the Minsk agreement holding little to no value offer very little comfort for the Ukrainian nation tackling the crisis. Furthermore, the responses from Russia’s side to Ukraine’s initiatives to foster a closer bond with EU can be seen to result in making them more sceptical and possibly less likely to enter further agreements.

&nbsp;

<strong>EU foreign policy making</strong> – “The EU’s modest diplomatic performance confirms a pattern of avoiding power and responsibility in the conflict.”<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> The European Union has often been criticised for not taking swift enough action in the crisis situations, as well as not being firm and efficient enough when doing so: Where else would it be as crucial as when talking about the safety of its borders, as is the case with Ukraine? The Union needs to revise its strategy security wise, and the steps it is ready to take not only diplomatically but also on the security front. What the crisis in Ukraine has highlighted is that the Union’s foreign policy making is still in baby shoes. The Union does not act and speak with a united voice in solving the crisis - instead of Mogherini [the High Representative] and Donald Tusk [Head of the European Commission] it is Angela Merkel [German chancellor] and Francois Hollande [French President] that have been leading the talks in Moscow and Kiev. Even if the cooperation between the EU and the US has been remarkable so far, it has been largely the heads of the Member States communicating with the US, so the link to the EU is not directly to the European but rather to the Member State level. This shows a continuing focus on national stances and undermines the EU’s role as a united foreign policy maker.

	<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Measures taken by the EU</span>

&nbsp;

Following the Russian annexation of Crimea, the Council of European Union has introduced <strong>three waves of restrictive measures</strong> against Russia, enforced in June 23, 2014, December 18, 2014 and January 29, 2015 respectively. The current sanctions policy towards Russia aims at the following targets: private entities and individuals via visa bans and freezes on assets, financial markets by banning long term EU-loans for the five state owned banks, the energy sector through restrictions on Rosneft, Trasneft and Gazprom Neft activities and the defence industry by means of blacklisting Russian ‘dual use’ (civil and military) technology manufacturers, such as the ‘Saiga’ producing Kalashnikov rifles. Furthermore, import and export of arms or related material is subject to embargo.

&nbsp;

In addition to sanctions directed to Russia, the EU's humanitarian and early recovery assistance in Ukraine currently amounts to a total of 95 million euros.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Measures taken by the international community </span>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>

<strong>NATO</strong> has increased its presence in the countries surrounding Ukraine, by building additional military bases and conducting surveillance flights over countries such as Romania and Poland.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>

&nbsp;

The <strong>US </strong>has worked together with the EU to ensure sanctions introduced by the two parties would be compatible with each other. Having so far refrained from supplying lethal weaponry, Obama admits that this is not out of question either. Additionally, Canada and a number of other countries have also introduced various sanctions on Russia.
