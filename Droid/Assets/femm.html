	<li><strong> Key terms</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Family planning -</strong> though understood differently by different groups, is defined by the World Health Organisation as “anticipating and attaining the desired number of children and the spacing and timing of their births<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a>”. This means it includes both preventing unwanted pregnancy, and becoming pregnant when desired.</li>
	<li><strong>Sexual and reproductive health – </strong>is the umbrella term given to a “state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being related to sexuality: not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a>”. It is understood to include sexuality and safe and pleasurable sexual relationships, freedom from coercion, discrimination and violence, but also covers medical and educational aids.</li>
	<li><strong>Maternal mortality</strong> - is the number of deaths (per 100 000 live births) of women while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy. It includes anything that might be related to or may have been aggravated by pregnancy, but does not include accidental or incidental causes.</li>
	<li><strong>Maternal morbidity</strong> - describes any decline in the health of a mother, as a direct result of her pregnancy.</li>
	<li>The <strong>Millennium Development Goals</strong> are a set of eight targets set by the United Nations, all to be achieved by 2015. The fifth Millennium Development Goal pledged to target maternal health (see facts and figures).</li>
	<li><strong>Genetic screening</strong> is a controversial process where prospective parents can test embryos for genetic diseases, or other potentially adverse characteristics. Most countries allow genetic screening for medical reasons, but do not for any other reason.</li>
</ul>

	<li><strong> Relevance and explanation of the issue</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

<em>“In Europe, many citizens assume that these battles have been won, taking their sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) - their right to decide - for granted. But we cannot afford to be complacent.” –<strong>Michael Cashman, MEP</strong></em>

<strong> </strong>

Reproductive rights are a subset of human rights that deal with areas of sexual health, family planning and reproductive freedom. Though their importance was first highlighted at the International Conference on Human Rights in Tehran in 1968, there is still significant lack of consensus both about what these rights entail, and how they should be guaranteed. The most widely agreed upon interpretation comes from the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), which published a programme of action<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a> in 1994 referring to the

&nbsp;

“right of men and women to be informed and to have access

to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of family

planning of their choice, as well as other methods of their choice

for regulation of fertility which are not against the law, and the

right of access to appropriate health-care services that will enable

women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth and provide

couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant”.

&nbsp;

Although this obviously was intended as neither an exhaustive list nor a complete definition, it does provide a sufficient basis for countries to attempt to guarantee the reproductive rights of their citizens. Despite this, few, and perhaps even no, countries discharge this burden completely.

&nbsp;

Some countries have been identified as being particularly weak. A UN report<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></a> from late 2014 pointed to specific failings in Romania, including a maternal mortality rate of twice the EU average and the highest number of live births among girls under fifteen. An unacceptably high rate of unregulated abortion is still present in many Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries, though this has decreased in recent years. Contraceptive usage in the CEE countries is similarly disappointing, with a 2012 report<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><sup><sup>[5]</sup></sup></a> highlighting the many causes, including among others, a lack of commitment to reproductive health, limited forms of contraception and information about how to use or choose between them and prohibitively high costs.

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, the depth and scale of the problem is difficult to quantify, as complete statistics exist in no state. Some countries suffer from an inability to collect full data, some choose not to measure a variety of indicators, some factors are difficult to measure and ultimately, because reproductive and sexual health covers such a variety of elements, measurement and comparison are not easy. One of the more difficult factors to quantify is sexual education. In European countries with significant Catholic populations like Ireland and Poland, “sex ed” often involves curricula far behind their more secular neighbours<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><sup><sup>[6]</sup></sup></a>, while in areas of the United Kingdom, Italy and some other countries sex education is not compulsory. National attitudes also play a role with discussion of sexual health still a taboo subject in certain countries. Often, sex education curricula are written intended to reduce the incidence of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and some other Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), and do not contain enough information about other aspects of sexual health.

&nbsp;

But reproductive rights pertain to safeguarding all aspects of the sexual health of women and men, and are not limited to guaranteeing that those who do not intend to become pregnant do not do so. There is an increasing movement of people demanding greater levels of control over what they believe to constitute “responsible reproduction”<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><sup><sup>[7]</sup></sup></a>, including screening for genetic illnesses. The United Kingdom recently became the first country to legalise the use of mitochondrial donation, whereby in-vitro fertilisation allows healthy mitochondria from a donor to replace the damaged mitochondria of the mother, thus avoiding a number of complex and serious diseases.

&nbsp;

Genetic screening of embryos is legal in Europe in cases where the transmission of genetic disease is likely, though embryo selection for non-medical reasons is strictly prohibited. This is likely to be an issue only in countries that have already achieved a certain level of basic reproductive rights, which many still struggle to reach.

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, many people conflate the terms “reproductive rights” and the right to legal abortion. These two things are not the same, though some countries may choose to provide access to abortion as one of the reproductive rights it guarantees. This misleading fallacy has distracted from the debate in many countries, and retarded proper legislation on abortion, and on other elements of sexual health.

&nbsp;

The combination of these factors and problems leads to a highly complex situation for European lawmakers and NGOs. No single strategy will address the problems specific to each country, and any standardised targets must recognise the different baselines from which each country begins. Lawmakers and citizens in some countries will also find certain elements of any proposed strategy unpalatable, but the priority must lie with safeguarding the health of European men and women.

<strong> </strong>
<ol start="3">
	<li><strong> Key questions</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
	<li>Why is there such a disparity in access to reproductive rights across the European continent?</li>
	<li>How can a comprehensive programme tackle basic issues such as maternal mortality and morbidity in Eastern European countries, as well as more advanced ones like access to cutting edge genetic medicine?</li>
	<li>How can the discourse surrounding reproductive rights avoid the over-politicisation that has so far hampered fruitful policy making? Is the legalisation of abortion central to this discourse, or incidental to it?</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>What is the role of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in the advancement of reproductive rights and sexual health? How is this best balanced with the role of national governments?</li>
	<li>To what extent should national governments provide free or subsidised access to family planning and sexual health services and resources?</li>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>
<ol start="4">
	<li><strong> Key facts and figures</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
	<li>Goal 5 of the Millennium Development Goals is the improvement of maternal health. Its targets include a reduction of three-quarters (from the 1990 rate) in the maternal mortality ratio by 2015, and universal access to reproductive health in 2015.</li>
	<li>Maternal mortality is the indicator most widely used to assess changes in maternal health. However, mortality does not, by definition, take into account changes in morbidity or quality of life. In many countries these data are not collected, and in some others they are not made available to NGOs wishing to assess progress. Maternal mortality figures for most countries globally are available here.</li>
	<li>The UK has one of the highest teenage birth and abortion rates in Western Europe, despite having the second highest use of contraception, Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia and Estonia all have similarly high rates.</li>
	<li>Latvia (at 34 per 100,000), Romania (at 27), Hungary (at 21) and Luxembourg (at 20) have maternal mortality rates far exceeding their other European neighbours, where the lower rates are between 2 and 10 per 100,000.</li>
	<li>Finland has a mandatory sexual education curriculum that is one of the most comprehensive worldwide, and makes emergency contraception available without prescription. This has lead to low and decreasing rates of unplanned adolescent pregnancy. However, Finland does not provide free contraception for all, nor do many other European Union Member States.</li>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>
<ol start="5">
	<li><strong> Key actors</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

Member States are the main source of legislation on reproductive rights. It is within the competence of each Member State to determine the content of its curricula, the medical practices it allows and subsidises, and the legality of any forms of contraception, including abortion. It is also on a national level that opinions are formed or challenged, meaning that the attitude of the citizenry has a large influence on the laws of that country, but also vice versa because of the normative effect of law. This also limits the influence other actors, including NGOs, can have on countries, especially on a legal level.

&nbsp;

The UN Population Fund describes itself as the “lead UN agency for delivering a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every birth safe and every young person’s potential fulfilled”.  The UNFPA has concentrated much of its work in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and determines that though improvements have been made since (date of prior WHO survey) these countries are still far away from having even acceptable levels of reproductive rights. The UNFPA is the main data-collecting organisation in the region, as well as the main source of assessment and statistics on the issue.

&nbsp;

The Centre for Reproductive Rights (CRR) is a global organisation that advocates for the right to abortion. It has helped numerous women take cases to the European Court of Human Rights in past years, and was one of the first groups to frame preventable maternal death as a human rights violation. The CRR believes that abortion is a fundamental reproductive right, and as such many of its campaigns are focused on forcing countries that outlaw it to legalise the practice, and obliging countries with restrictions to loosen them.

&nbsp;

ASTRA is a network of activist organisations, operating mainly in Central and Eastern Europe. It aims to promote women's sexual and reproductive health and rights in the region and to ensure a prominent place for these issues on national and regional agendas. It collaborates with other European NGOs often as part of a network including European NGOs for Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights, Population and Development (EuroNGOs), Countdown 2015 Europe, the International Planned Parenthood Federation, European Network (IPPF EN).

&nbsp;

EUROSTAT is the European Statistics Agency, which exists as a Directorate General and provides statistics to other EU bodies. REPROSTAT is a project coordinated by EUROSTAT to investigate indicators of reproductive health in the EU.

&nbsp;

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has so far played a defining role in shaping the conversation about reproductive rights. Though the work of the WHO is predominantly in developing countries, it also works to “develop norms, tools and guidelines on reproductive health in general and abortion services in particular, and supports countries in reforming their health systems” over the world, including in Europe.

<strong> </strong>
<ol start="6">
	<li><strong> Key conflicts</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

Disputes over the content of sexual education classes are widespread in several European countries. The objections are often on religious grounds, either from advocacy groups that lobby for the omission of certain subjects, or from parents who maintain that their right to practise religion, and raise their children within the auspices of that faith should be grounds enough to withdraw their child from any class that may be inconsistent. The balance between guaranteeing the future safety of these children and those around them with their freedom to practice religion requires the treading of a fine line, and cannot be resolved without sensitivity.

&nbsp;

The introduction of the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine, intended to combat the incidence of cervical cancer also provoked backlash in a number of countries. Much of this was from conservative elements of the population who objected to the need to determine and codify the age of sexual maturity in adolescent girls as a step that would become normative.

&nbsp;

Many groups who advocate for reproductive rights include abortion among the resources they would like to see. In countries where there is significant opposition to abortion only this reduces the political capital of these organisations and politicians and decreases their ability to achieve other incremental changes to policy. Organisations like the CRR, an American NGO, have created substantial backlash, and for countries who oppose the legalisation of abortion like Ireland, this has created entrenchment and significantly hampered fruitful discourse.

&nbsp;

The debate over genetic screening revolves around the fear that parents and doctors will choose to “play God” with the power they would wield. Currently, genetic screening is allowed only in the case where parents fear they may pass on hereditary disease, but in vitro tests could also be performed to determine, and therefore choose an embryo based on gender, or certain physical or genetic traits. Significant opposition exists from conservatives about <em>any</em> kind of genetic testing or interference, as was recently evident in the criticism of the UK’s move to legalise mitochondrial donation.

&nbsp;
<ol start="7">
	<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

Several European countries have instituted a vaccination programme, providing inoculations against HPV, a sexually transmitted infection that increases susceptibility to cervical cancer. <a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><sup><sup>[8]</sup></sup></a>

&nbsp;

The Millennium Development Goals (in particular Goal 5) were intended more as a global goal, and as such work toward the targets has mainly focused on Africa and East Asia. Maternal mortality in the period 1990 to 2015 has actually increased in some European countries<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><sup><sup>[9]</sup></sup></a>, and the success of increasing access to reproductive health has been mixed, though data are scarce.

&nbsp;

Several investigations into increasing the quality of sexual education in schools have been carried out by the European Parliament<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><sup><sup>[10]</sup></sup></a>, which determined that while quality was mixed, programmes were “improving”. The report juxtaposed the current state of the curricula against a time when these classes were almost all voluntary and infrequent, and so this qualification is very much relative, and is not an especially positive review in absolute terms.

&nbsp;

Between 2003 and 2006 the European Commission maintained a funding instrument<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><sup><sup>[11]</sup></sup></a> through which aimed to increase access to and quality of reproductive rights in Member States. This instrument provided funds to national and local governments and NGOs for research and the provision of services. This was to be augmented by an EP resolution in 2013<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><sup><sup>[12]</sup></sup></a> that stressed that a “strong EU position” on RR would require “a strong push” from the EP, but ultimately failed to provide such strength.

&nbsp;

The European Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights Community released a position paper<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><sup><sup>[13]</sup></sup></a> on the post 2015 agenda with five goals: gender equality, women’s empowerment and women’s rights; the formalisation of a goal with specific health targets; the addressing of population dynamics as a human rights issue; a formal educational goal and a focus on European youth.
