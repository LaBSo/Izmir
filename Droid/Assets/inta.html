<ol>
	<li><strong> Key terms</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) </strong>– A proposed free trade agreement between the US and the European Union. The negotiations were to be concluded by the end of 2014, but this was later rescheduled to 2015.</li>
	<li><strong>Free Trade Agreement (FTA) </strong>– A binding agreement between two parties to jointly lower tariffs and barriers on goods and services between them.</li>
	<li><strong>Non-tariff barriers (NTBs) </strong>–Trade barriers that restrict imports but are not in the form of a tariff. Such barriers greatly increase the cost of doing business in different legislative environments. Examples include quality standards, shipping and label requirements, and technical or legal requirements for imported products.</li>
	<li><strong>Customs Union</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> – Characterised by an absence of internal borders, the customs union is an essential foundation of the EU. According to Article 28 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), it applies to all trade of goods. Goods moving freely within the Union comply with the rules of the internal market and with certain provisions of the Common Commercial Policy.</li>
	<li><strong>Common Customs Tariff (CCT)</strong><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> – It is a tariff that applies to the import of goods across the external borders of the EU. The tariff is common to imports into to all EU members, but the rates of duty differ from one kind of import to another depending on what they are and where they come from.</li>
	<li><strong>Consumer protection</strong> – EU legislation (Article 12 TFEU, Charter of Fundamental Rights<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>) guarantees products that meet acceptable standards and a right of redress if something goes wrong. Consumer protection is ensured by food and product safety or data protection<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>, among others.</li>
	<li><strong>Market Surveillance </strong>– It ensures that non-food products on the EU market do not endanger European consumers and workers, or the protection of other public interests such as environment, security, and fairness in trade.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>. The implementation of market surveillance remains a shared competence where the Member States must translate EU goals into their national legislation.</li>

<em>"I want a reasonable and balanced trade agreement with the US. But I will not sacrifice Europe's safety, health, social and data protection standards, or our cultural diversity, on the altar of free trade." <a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><strong>[6]</strong></a>– <strong>Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission</strong></em>

<em> </em>

The transatlantic economic and trade relationship is the backbone of the world economy. Together, the EU and the United States of America (US) account for nearly half of the world’s GDP (47%), and one-third of global trade. Every day, goods and services worth €2 billion are traded between both parties and about 15 million jobs depend on the strong ties between the EU and US economies.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>

&nbsp;

In times when the EU’s economic growth is staggering and the unemployment rates in especially the southern Member States reach new peaks, the free trade agreement between the EU and the US seems like a suitable additional pulse for the European economic engine. According to a study by the European Commission<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><sup><sup>[8]</sup></sup></a> (EC), the size of the EU´s economy is expected to grow by 0.5% of GDP after the ratification of the agreement. Among others, that means that the EU’s export sector could increase by several millions of jobs and that wages for both skilled and less skilled workers might grow by 0.5%. At the same time, the lowering of production costs and the costs for exports between the two markets could lead to cheaper products for the consumers. The study estimates that the average European household of four will see its disposable income increase by about €500 per year, as a result of the combined effect of wage increases and price reductions.

&nbsp;

During the EU-US Summit in November 2011, leaders of the European Union and the United States tasked the <strong>Transatlantic Economic Council</strong><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a><strong> (TEC) </strong>to establish a High Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth chaired by the US Trade Representative and the EU Trade Commissioner. The Working Group was requested to identify measures to increase EU-US trade and investment. In February 2013, the recommendation of the High Level Working Group to launch negotiations on a comprehensive economic and free trade agreement was endorsed by the EC. These negotiations began in July 2013.

In February 2015, the 8<sup>th</sup> round of negotiations between the EU, led by EU Chief Negotiator Ignacio Garcia Bercero and his counterpart <strong>United States Trade Representative</strong><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a><strong> (USTR) </strong>Ambassador Michael Froman took place in Brussels. Nearly all areas of the TTIP have been discussed except for the Investor-State-Dispute-Settlement (ISDS). It has been publicly announced that both parties agree that regulators from both sides need to be included in the negotiations and that the EU’s standards of consumer, health and environment protection cannot be downgraded. A consensus on the food safety, and animal and plant health matters seems to have been achieved. Thus, both the US and the EU have expressed their belief in environmental protection. A common ground and the consolidation in these areas shall be finalised during the next discussion rounds. Thus, major stakeholders coming mainly from the private sector will be consulted in the run up to the next discussion round to ensure good regulatory practices<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>.

<strong> </strong>
<ol start="3">
	<li><strong> Key questions</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
	<li>With small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) being the backbone of the EU’s economy, are the current EU targets sufficient to ensure SMEs can fully profit from the TTIP<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>?</li>
	<li>Which negotiating strategy should the EU adapt to meet its targets and defend its high standards in terms of food and product safety, environment, data and health protection as well as labour rights<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>?</li>
	<li>Keeping in mind the recent elections in Greece and the clear rejection of the ISDS clause by the newly elected government<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>, which strategic steps should the EU take towards that matter that was left out in the 8<sup>th</sup> round the discussions<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>?</li>
	<li>US and European regulatory mechanisms are among the most advanced ones worldwide, yet they often differ; with cutting red tape being the overarching aim, what approach should the EU and the US take to work towards global cooperation on regulatory issues<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>?</li>
	<li>Given that both the EU Member States and the US comply with the same rules regarding intellectual property (IP) law, which direction should the TTIP negotiations take in order to meet the EU’s objectives to improve the protection and enforcement of IP rights in third countries<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>?</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ol start="4">
	<li><strong> Key facts and figures</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li>Yearly, the TTIP could boost growth to the benefit of citizens and companies by €120 billion of EU’s economy<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>SMEs account for some 67% of the jobs in EU<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>.</li>
	<li>The tertiary sector accounts for as much as 60% of the EU economy<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>.</li>
	<li>According to Article 3 of the TFEU, the EU has exclusive competence<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a> in the field of trade and negotiates international agreements on behalf of the Union on the bilateral and multilateral levels.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The TTIP would partially devalue existing preference agreements with third countries; EU trade with neighbouring states in North Africa and Eastern Europe would decline by an average of 5% given a comprehensive agreement<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>.</li>
	<li>The US has ratified 14 out of the 189 conventions of the International Labour Organisation<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>, Germany 85, France 125, and Croatia 60.</li>
	<li>The negotiated texts have been published on January 7, 2015<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>. At the end of the 8<sup>th</sup> round of negotiations in Brussels, EU Chief Negotiator Ignacio Garcia Bercero already announced that two more negotiation meetings have been scheduled before the summer break<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a>.</li>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>
<ol start="5">
	<li><strong> Key actors</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

In 2013, the governments of the EU Member States gave the <strong>European Commission </strong>a mandate to negotiate the TTIP from June 2013 onwards. At the end of the negotiations, the negotiated texts will be given to the Council and the European Parliament for a unanimous double democratic guarantee. The newly elected President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker lists the conclusion of the negotiations as one his priorities<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>. The <strong>Directorate-General (DG) for Trade </strong>and<strong> EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström</strong> are mandated with the negotiations with regards to the bilateral Free Trade Agreement with the US that respects EU citizens’ safety, health, social and data protection and cultural diversity<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a>.

&nbsp;

Further, the <strong>DG for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs</strong> and <strong>EU Commissioner Elżbieta Bieńkowska<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28"><strong>[28]</strong></a> </strong>actively participate in the negotiations for a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. The DG for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs ensures, among others, an open internal market for goods and services in the EU and improves the range, quality, and competitiveness of products and services on the internal market. Thus, the DG for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs is involved on a day-to-day basis in the TTIP negotiations, which are undertaken under DG Trade's coordination. The negotiations include three equally important pillars: market access, NTBs, and rules to address global challenges<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a>.

&nbsp;

The<strong> USTR </strong>is the negotiating body for the TTIP matters from the US side. Thus, the<strong> TEC </strong>is the body that directs the economic cooperation between the US and the EU. The Council is tasked with regulation harmonisation and deepen the cooperation between the governments in economic issues.

&nbsp;
<ol start="6">
	<li><strong> Key conflicts</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

While many discussion points are currently being negotiated between the US and the EU, the fundamental challenge lies in the fact that, for the first time in history, the two biggest economies worldwide are trying to create one common free trade economic area. To successfully cut red tape, both parties need to find an understanding of how to balance the clear benefits of the TTIP whilst hearing the concerns of the numerous activists’ groups<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a> with regards to the ISDS and the reduction of environmental, public services, and consumer standards<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a>.

&nbsp;

The ISDS chapter seems to be the source of the biggest concerns towards the TTIP by both, political opponents and activists’ groups. Surprisingly, this very chapter was the only one left out of the discussions during the 8<sup>th</sup> round of negotiations and is planned to be discussed in the final phase of the negotiations only<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a>. There is a strong suspicion that US companies, with their litigious approach, will use ISDS as a means of putting the frighteners on elected governments.

&nbsp;

The US Dodd-Frank Act signed in 2010<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a> as a response to the devastating causes of the financial crisis of 2008 has enhanced the regulations of the formerly loose US financial sector very heavily. The US argues that Dodd-Frank is moving at a faster pace than its EU equivalent, the EC Capital Requirements Directive IV<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a>. While the Dodd-Frank Act has enhanced financial regulation in the US, the EU has moved toward a banking union and increased regulatory oversight<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a>.

&nbsp;

Though either approach is not necessarily excluding the other, the EU and the US must find a common way forward by either choosing to mutually recognise each others’ standards, go ahead with one set of rules or develop a harmonised set of rules.

&nbsp;
<ol start="7">
	<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

In general, tariffs between the EU and the US are already relatively low given the size of the trading bloc (under 3%)<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a>, however they are not entirely eliminated. Whilst there is no agreement like the TTIP in terms of scale there are many other FTAs that have paved the way for these talks as free trade has been on the global agenda for many decades with the trend being undisputedly towards lowering tariffs and barriers. However few attempts have been made at NTBs before<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a>.

&nbsp;

The EU aims at keeping its strict legislation regarding food safety, and animal and plant health. The EU is aiming at keeping its restrictions on hormones or growth promoters in livestock farming. Thus, growing genetically modified organisms (GMOs) will prospectively be subject to an authorisation process in line with EU law<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a>. Within EU legislation, GMOs are subject to extensive, case-by-case, science-based food evaluation by the European Food Safety Authority<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a>.

&nbsp;

In January 2012, the EC has proposed a comprehensive reform of the EU's 1995 data protection rules to strengthen online privacy rights and boost Europe's digital economy<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a>. The proposed new EU data protection regime extends the scope of EU data protection law to all foreign companies processing data of EU residents. It provides a harmonisation of the data protection regulations throughout the EU, thereby making it easier for US companies to comply with these regulations; however, this comes at the cost of a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to 2% of worldwide<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a>.

&nbsp;

The ratification of the agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a> (TRIPs) is a compulsory requirement of World Trade Organisation (WTO) membership and the access to numerous international markets opened by the WTO coming with it. The TRIPs agreement covers a wide range of IP areas ranging from copyright to trademarks. Both, EU Member States and the US are members of the WTO and thereby comply with the TRIPs agreement.

Investment is a vital part of any economy and investors need to be sure that they will be treated fairly when investing abroad. That is why the EU wants to prevent ISDS abuse and conflicts of interest in arbitrators by introducing a code of conduct. Thus, introducing safeguards preventing tribunals from ordering the repeal of governmental measures are meant to allow Member States to maintain control over the interpretation of investment provision<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a>.
