				Overview = "<h2>Committee on Constitutional Affairs I (Afco I)</h2>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nChairperson: Lea Schiewer (DE)\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong> Key terms</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Copenhagen Criteria</strong> – A country willing to join the European Union (EU) has to first meet the key criteria for accession, also referred to as ‘Copenhagen criteria’. These criteria involve:\n<ul>\n\t<li>stable institutions guaranteeing the basic values of the EU<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a>;</li>\n\t<li>a functioning and competitive market economy;</li>\n\t<li>adaption of the domestic administrative and judicial system to the so-called <em>acquis communautaire</em>, meaning the collective body of EU legislation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\t<li><strong>Chapter </strong>– The EU’s approximately 80.000 pages long <em>acquis communautaire</em> consists of 35 chapters, each dealing with rules and regulations of a particular policy field.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n\t<li><strong> Relevance and explanation of the issue</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\n<em>“The Turks have only ever gone in one direction -- towards the West.”– <strong>Mustafa Kemal Atatürk</strong></em>\n\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n\nRegarding the current state of play in the accession negotiations between Turkey and the EU, the European Commission’s latest Progress Report on Turkey, published in October 2014, gave a rather ambivalent summary of the negotiation’s status quo. Despite some important steps forward over the past twelve months such as the signature and entry into force of the EU-Turkey Readmission Agreement (cf. section 7) or the continuous efforts to settle the Kurdish question, the report’s tenor was characterised by various concerns. These relate amongst others “to the adoption of the legislation undermining the independence, efficiency and impartiality of the judiciary [...] [or] blanket bans imposed on social media.” <a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a> The analysis’ result mirrors the ongoing stagnation of the accession negotiations between Turkey and the European Union since its beginning in 2005.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlthough the start of Turkish-European relations in the way we know it date back to the 1960s, Turkey officially applied for membership in 1987 and was granted the status of candidate country by the European Council in 1999.\n\nA few years later the Council concluded that accession negotiations could be opened as of October 2005. <a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\">[3]</a> Since then one chapter of the acquis communautaire, Science and Research, has been provisionally closed, whilst another fourteen have been opened. However, due to the Cyprus question (cf. section 7) eight chapters cannot be opened and none provisionally closed until this matter is settled.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHow is it that this accession process is coined by toing and froing? Apart from Turkey’s efforts to fulfil the Copenhagen Criteria, its membership request has opened a general debate on the country’s affiliation to the EU. For a deeper understanding, this debate can be divided into three main subjects: politics, economy and identity.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMember States opposed to the accession of Turkey emphasise cultural differences (cf. Section 6). They note that never in the EU’s enlargement history has a Muslim-majority population been integrated into the Union. Hence the cultural implications on both sides are hard to predict, let alone the amount of seats in the European Parliament Turkey would be entitled to, given its population of about 76 million people.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEconomic concerns relate to the potential influx of Turkish work-seekers in the EU’s labour market given the current high rate of unemployment in several Member States, and other questions about Turkey’s long-term economic stability.\nRegarding the political sphere, the Turkish government aroused serious criticism for its repressive treatment of protesters during the course of the Gezi Park and Taksim Square protests and allegations of corruption in 2013. In addition to this, an Internal Security Bill proposed by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) caused some anxiety both within the parliament and the civil society in Turkey, as well as in Member States. Despite concerns raised over the provisions that prevent the exercise of the democratic rights to protest and to organise, and further expand the police’s ability to tackle public demonstrations and broaden their scope to use firearms against protesters<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\"><sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></a>, and after much controversy, the bill was passed in the Turkish Grand National Assembly in late February 2015.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn a nutshell, it can be said that the accession process has lost its momentum. Besides, as regular Europe-wide polls have shown, there is a decline in support for the membership on the part of both the EU’s and Turkey’s population. However, as far as the two parties are concerned it is out of the question that Turkey is and needs to be affiliated to the EU. Thus, it is to clarify how EU-Turkey relations can be refined for mutual benefit.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"3\">\n\t<li><strong> Key questions</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Does the EU still consider Turkey to be a future member or rather a neighbour with a special relationship?\n<ul>\n\t<li>What would a special relationship look like?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\t<li>If the EU still is supportive of the candidature, how can it convince and support the Turkish authorities to initiate and implement the necessary reforms?</li>\n\t<li>How can the EU address issues such as the Kurdish conflict, the Cyprus question and the Armenian genocide?</li>\n\t<li>Does the EU face the limits of its integration capacity or does it suffer from enlargement fatigue?</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n\t<li><strong> Key facts and figures</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>The EU is Turkey’s largest trading partner, while Turkey is the EU’s sixth largest. <a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\">[5]</a></li>\n\t<li>Turkey is the world’s 16th largest economy.</li>\n\t<li>Turkey’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita amounts to only half of EU-average. <a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\">[6]</a></li>\n\t<li>In 2014 Turkey was ranked 64 out of 175 countries in the Corruption Perception Index of Transparency International 2014 (rank 58 in 2008).<a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\">[7]</a></li>\n\t<li>Turkey has a 10% threshold in parliamentary elections.</li>\n\t<li>The World Press Freedom Index assigned rank 154 out of 180 to Turkey (rank 98/161 in 2005).<a href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\">[8]</a></li>\n\t<li>Turkey is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) since 1952, having the alliance’s second largest army at command, and an ally with Israel and the United States.</li>\n\t<li>Turkey is neighbour to two Member States on the west; Greece and Bulgaria. Additionally, it also shares borders with Syria, Iraq, Iran and Georgia and one closed border with Armenia.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n\t<li><strong> Key actors</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nRegarding Turkey’s candidature, a great amount of actors are involved in the accession process. On the one hand there is the <strong>Turkish government</strong>, represented by the former Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who became the first directly elected President last August, and his successor in office, new Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu. Erdoğan declared in his inauguration speech that the accession negotiations remain a strategic target for Turkey. Both politicians belong to the Justice and Development Party (AKP) that came into power in 2002 and ever since initiated eight reform packages, e.g. the ban on death penalty and torture.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOn the other hand there are the European institutions with the <strong>European Commission</strong> leading the way. The Commission, embodied by Johannes Hahn, the Austrian Commissioner responsible for enlargement and European neighbourhood policy and Federice Mogherini, the High Representative for Foreign Affairs, accounts for the conduct, monitoring and evaluation of the accession negotiations. Amongst others it carries out the initial screening, presents the annual progress reports and facilitates the dialogue between the candidate country and Member States by means of bilateral meetings.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe <strong>European Parliament</strong> has a rather advisory role in the negotiations. However, once the talks are completed the EP has to give its assent to conclude the accession process. In order to involve the only directly legitimised institution from the very beginning <strong>Joint Parliamentary Committees</strong> (JPC) for each candidate country have been established. Composed of an equal number of Members of the Turkish Grand National Assembly and of the European Parliament, the EU-Turkey JPC meets twice a year discussing the progress and obstacles faced during the negotiations.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Member States’</strong> support for a candidate country is decisive for the negotiations’ success. Only after the approval of all 28 national parliaments, followed by an unanimous vote and the signature of the final treaty will the candidate ultimately be able to join the EU.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"6\">\n\t<li><strong> Key conflicts</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nThe central conflict the Committee on Constitutional Affairs I has to deal with is the question of whether Turkey is considered to be a <strong>member or a neighbour</strong> of the European Union and how this shapes the current and future EU-Turkey relations. There are several other conflicts that derive from this controversy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOne is the continuous disagreement between the Member States regarding their support or opposition to the Turkish accession. Despite Turkey’s readiness to start further accession negotiations on particular chapters, stagnation prevails. The progress report 2014 states: “Of a total of 33 reports, nine are pending in the Council. Work on a number of negotiating chapters has been interrupted over the years, due to lack of consensus among Member States.”<a href=\"#_ftn9\" name=\"_ftnref9\">[9]</a> However, this consensus is crucial for the final vote on the Turkish accession after the negotiations are closed, for it has to be unanimous to grant membership to a candidate.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt the European level, one must bear in mind that the domestic situations in each Member State potentially differ. Countries such as France, Greece and Germany are known to oppose to Turkey’s accession. They favour alternate forms of affiliation: one being the already created Union for the Mediterranean as proposed by former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, another being a privileged partnership as suggested by the German government in 2004. Countries, which express their support for the membership request, are amongst others Poland, United Kingdom and Sweden.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThese diverging stances are due to a second conflict – the question whether Turkey is compatible with European values or not. Opponents sometimes refer to a “clash of civilisations”, meaning that both Turkish society and culture do not go hand in hand with the liberal-democratic values such as democracy, rule of law, respect of minorities and protection of human rights that the EU promotes. In order to support their claim they refer to the Kurdish issue, the unresolved Cyprus dispute and the non-recognition of the Armenian genocide by the Turkish government. In addition to this, the recent adoption of legislation limiting the freedom of expression, such as the Criminal Code or the Anti-Terror Law, the blanket ban on Social Media and the police raids on leading newspapers and TV stations in 2014, raised concern among Member States. The High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Federica Mogherini, and Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn described these raids as “incompatible with the freedom of media, which is a core principle of democracy.” <a href=\"#_ftn10\" name=\"_ftnref10\">[10]</a> They further stated: “We recall that any further step towards accession with any candidate country depends on the full respect for the rule of law and fundamental rights.” <a href=\"#_ftn11\" name=\"_ftnref11\">[11]</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"7\">\n\t<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nThe lengthy accession proceedings go along with diverse treaties and measures established to answer the question how Turkey should be related to the EU. In 1963 European Economic Community (EEC), the predecessor of the EU, established a treaty-based relation with Turkey by signing the <strong>Ankara Association Agreement</strong><a href=\"#_ftn12\" name=\"_ftnref12\">[12]</a>. This laid the foundation for the following economic cooperation and the progressive formation of a custom union, which was formed in 1995. Article 28 of the agreement pointed out the prospect of an accession: “As soon as the operation of this Agreement has advanced far enough [...] the Contracting Parties shall examine the possibility of the accession of Turkey to the Community.”<a href=\"#_ftn13\" name=\"_ftnref13\">[13]</a> However, after the EU enlargement in 2004, the <strong>Additional Protocol</strong>, which had supplemented the Ankara agreement since 1970, needed to be expanded in order to incorporate the new Member States into the custom union. Consequently, Turkey declared its continuing non-recognition of the Republic of Cyprus. Despite the EU rejection of this declaration, Cyprus has not been granted the right of free movement of goods on Turkish territory to the present day. This treaty violation caused the Council of the EU in 2006 to partially suspend the accession negotiations. Henceforth, eight relevant chapters<a href=\"#_ftn14\" name=\"_ftnref14\">[14]</a> will remain unopened and none will be closed until Turkey implements the Additional Protocol without any exceptions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn order to resolve the Cyprus question the EU has launched an <strong>aid programme for the Turkish-Cypriot community</strong> in 2006. The programme’s purpose is mainly the promotion of civil society and confidence-building to encourage dialogue between the Turkish-Cypriot community and the EU.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBeing an accession candidate entitles Turkey to receive funding from the <strong>Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA)</strong>. The IPA serves as the EU’s financial and technical support for candidate countries providing them with the necessary capacity for reforms and development. For the 2007-2013 period Turkey could call on a total of about 4.9 billion euros. The successor programme IPA II could liquidate assets of around 2.6\u00a0billion euros for the 2014-2017 period. The Commission and Turkey modified IPA II’s framework and priorities as set out in the <strong>Indicative Strategy Paper for Turkey</strong> for the period 2014-2020<a href=\"#_ftn15\" name=\"_ftnref15\">[15]</a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFurthermore, the EU and Turkey started negotiating a <strong>Readmission agreement </strong>in 2011, which aims to establish procedures and obligations between the two contracting parties that facilitate the readmission of persons illegally residing or having entered their territory. In December 2013 the Turkish Parliament ratified the agreement and took an “important step to a visa-free regime for Turks travelling to the EU”<a href=\"#_ftn16\" name=\"_ftnref16\">[16]</a>, as the former Commissioner for Enlargement Stefan Füle said. Namely because the EU in return started visa liberalisation talks with Turkey. The objective of these talks is the elimination of the visa obligation currently imposed on Turkish citizens.\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nIn order to bring new momentum to the accession process, the European Commission in collaboration with Turkish authorities and civil society representatives launched the so-called <strong>Positive Agenda </strong>in 2012.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis unheard-of innovative enlargement policy technique is meant to be a complement to the accession process. It is supposed to rebuild confidence in the EU-Turkey relations and increase public support. The initiative sets up eight working groups, each composed of both Eurocrats and Turkish bureaucrats and allocated to a specific chapter, that aim to advance the harmonisation of Turkish law with EU legislation by means of a technical dialogue. Among these chapters are “Judiciary and Fundamental Rights” as well as “Justice, Freedom and Security”.\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nIn addition to the afore mentioned measures, it is important to also point to the new <strong>European Union Strategy </strong>the newly elected Turkish government mapped out in 2014. It outlines how Turkey intends to revive the domestic reform process and improve its communication with the EU. Amongst others it focuses on enhancing the implementation capacity of legal adjustments and refines the concrete measures necessary for the closure of each negotiation chapter.\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n\t<li><strong> Links for further research</strong></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>General information on the accession process</em>\n\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n<ul>\n\t<li><em>European Commission: General information about enlargement:\n</em><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/\">http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/</a></li>\n\t<li><em>EU legislation: The accession process for a new Member State:</em>\n<a href=\"http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/enlargement/ongoing_enlargement/l14536_en.htm\">http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/enlargement/ongoing_enlargement/l14536_en.htm</a></li>\n</ul>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n\n<em>Assessment of the negotiations’ progress</em>\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>The European Commission’s latest progress report on Turkey (2014): <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/pdf/key_documents/2014/20141008-turkey-progress-report_en.pdf\">http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/pdf/key_documents/2014/20141008-turkey-progress-report_en.pdf</a></li>\n\t<li><em>Turkey’s European Union Strategy (2014)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://www.ab.gov.tr/files/foto/eu_strategy.pdf\">http://www.ab.gov.tr/files/foto/eu_strategy.pdf</a>\n<ul>\n\t<li><em>EurActiv: Turkey’s EU accession negotiations should now be suspended (2014):</em></li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://www.euractiv.com/sections/europes-east/turkeys-eu-accession-negotiations-should-now-be-suspended-310855\">http://www.euractiv.com/sections/europes-east/turkeys-eu-accession-negotiations-should-now-be-suspended-310855</a>\n<ul>\n\t<li><em>European Commission on EU-Turkey relations (2014):</em></li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/candidate-countries/turkey/eu_turkey_relations_en.htm\">http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/candidate-countries/turkey/eu_turkey_relations_en.htm</a>\n<ul>\n\t<li><em>Turkish ministry of Foreign Affairs on Turkey-EU relations (2014):</em></li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://www.mfa.gov.tr/relations-between-turkey-and-the-european-union.en.mfa\">http://www.mfa.gov.tr/relations-between-turkey-and-the-european-union.en.mfa</a>\n<ul>\n\t<li><em>Hearing of Commissioner Hahn on Turkish accession (2014):</em>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO7Iroz9jZA\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO7Iroz9jZA</a></li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"1099\">\n<ul>\n\t<li>‪<em>BBC News: Turkey seen as not European enough to join EU (2013):</em></li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE66PFTTKaI\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE66PFTTKaI</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Debate on Identity -

There are different ways of distinguishing between the types of Euroscepticism; one is hard/soft (Taggart and Szczerbiak, 2002:7) which separates principled opposition to European integration [hard] from qualified opposition in some policy areas [soft].\nKopecky and Muddle (2002) offer a four-part distinction<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a>.\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Eurorejects</strong> oppose the ideal of integration and the reality of the EU.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Eurosceptics </strong>support the idea of integration, but not its current realization.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Europragmatists </strong>do not support integration, but view the EU as useful.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Euroenthusiasts </strong>support both the ideal of ever-closer union and the EU.\nThese neat definitions are rarely reflected in the media and general political debate.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\t<li><strong>Eurosceptic parties – </strong>As with Euroscepticism, different political parties have diverse objections to the European integration and the EU. The link between parties and mass opinion is complex, as research has shown that political elites can help to determine citizens’ attitudes (especially in places where trust in political institutions is relatively high) whilst public opinion can cue parties stances (usually in countries with proportional representation). It is also important to bear in mind that a party’s stance on the EU can be at least partly influenced by strategy, as the public is more likely to be mobilised by protest parties that frame the EU in Eurosceptic terms. One view is that ideology forms broad attitudes towards integration whilst strategy determines a party’s support for the EU’s current path<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\">[3]</a>. Others argue that geopolitics also play a role<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\">[4]</a>, such as the EFDD group<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\">[5]</a> in the European Parliament.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n\t<li><strong> Relevance and explanation of the issue</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\n<em>“When people stand up and talk about the great success that the EU has been, I'm not sure anybody saying it really believes it themselves anymore” – <strong>Nigel Farange, Leader of the UK Indepedence Party </strong></em>\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nOpposition to the idea of European integration along with criticisms of the current state of integration, and the various policies enacted by the institutions afforded power by the integration process, are as old as the ideas themselves. However in the beginning of the European project, there was much less principled objection to integration. The early days of cooperation relied on the ‘permissive consensus’ of public opinion<a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\">[6]</a>; voters did not really care what was going on in Brussels. Despite, or perhaps because of, a lack of interest the explicit goal of European integration has remained “an ever closer union”, part of every treaty since the first in 1957<a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\">[7]</a><a href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\">[8]</a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis ambivalence turned into relatively broad Euroenthusiasm as member state governments began persuading their citizens of the value of renewed European project. Most of these visions argued that integration would bring economic rewards. Fewer focused on common European values. During this time awareness of the European project increased as the effects of national policies became more apparent. By 1991 over 70% of Europeans on average across the European Community thought that membership was a good thing<a href=\"#_ftn9\" name=\"_ftnref9\">[9]</a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHowever as integration became more complicated, with more powers devolved to Brussels and more countries joining in, public opinion began to turn. Member States could no longer rely on passive voters, and public referendums on the state of European integration in France, the Netherlands and Ireland very nearly slammed the brakes on European integration<a href=\"#_ftn10\" name=\"_ftnref10\">[10]</a>. During the subsequent economic crisis public opinion on the EU fluctuated greatly as the institutions of the EU and European leaders came under great criticism. However, 2014 saw the proportion of Europeans with a positive impression of the EU outnumber neutrals for the first time since 2011 (negative impressions polled last)<a href=\"#_ftn11\" name=\"_ftnref11\">[11]</a>. In the same year, the European Parliament elections were billed as a massive success for Eurosceptic and anti-austerity parties. Despite intensive media coverage of the election, overall turnout continued its decline<a href=\"#_ftn12\" name=\"_ftnref12\">[12]</a>. Clearly there is still a great deal of dissatisfaction with the current state and future aims of the European Union.\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n\t<li><strong> Key questions</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Is the goal of an ever-closer union sustainable?\n<ul>\n\t<li>Is the nature of integration relevant to the concerns of Eurosceptics?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\t<li>Is the institutional setup of the EU, or the current policies enacted by the Union, to blame for the rise in Euroscepticism?\n<ul>\n\t<li>Are criticisms of austerity the same as criticisms of the EU/European integration?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\t<li>Should the basic structure of EU institutions change, if so how?</li>\n\t<li>To what extent do Eurosceptic parties represent the genuine concerns of European citizens?</li>\n\t<li>Are there ways of increasing voter turnout and trust through the policy process rather than institutional reform?</li>\n\t<li>How is perception of the EU affected by media framing, political communication and political systems?</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n\t<li><strong> Key facts and figures</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Voter turnout in EP elections has declined at every election since the first in 1979, from 62% to 42.5%.<a href=\"#_ftn13\" name=\"_ftnref13\">[13]</a></li>\n\t<li>Half of European citizens distrust the European Union<a href=\"#_ftn14\" name=\"_ftnref14\">[14]</a>.</li>\n\t<li>Perhaps surprisingly, support for the enlargements (usually cited as a major concern of Eurosceptics) in May 2004 and January 2007 was fairly lukewarm<a href=\"#_ftn15\" name=\"_ftnref15\">[15]</a> with a majority in favour (46% vs. 42% in 2006)<a href=\"#_ftn16\" name=\"_ftnref16\">[16]</a>.

That implies that the <strong>European Commission</strong> as the initiator of legislation and executive body, the <strong>Council of Ministers </strong>and <strong>European Parliament </strong>as equals in decision-making procedure along with the <strong>European Council </strong>(heads of the Member States that set the long term direction of the Union) may all be to blame. The relevance of these actors in relation to <strong>Member State governments </strong>in ensuring what happens at the European level reflects the wishes of the electorate defines the legitimacy of the European Union in the eyes of its citizens. <strong>Eurosceptic parties </strong>are key, as the concerns they represent may be irresolvable at the EU level, or even just down to electoral strategy.\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n\t<li><strong> Key conflicts</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nThe key conflict is if declining voter turnout, a lack of trust in EU institutions and the rise of Eurosceptic parties calls for a drastic change in the aims of the EU, a change in the way the EU works, or if the current policies of the Union are solely to blame. The causes of, and solutions to, Euroscepticism are not necessarily mutually exclusive.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Changing the aims of the EU</strong> means examining if the means of continued cooperation through further integration <em>at different speeds</em> is viable. It might be the case that an ‘ever-closer union’ should no longer be the aim, that that integration should generally proceed at a slower or faster pace, or that Member States should no longer be allowed to integrate at different speeds (thus abandoning ‘<em>differentiated integration’</em>).\n<strong>Changing the way the EU works</strong> could mean giving more or less power to the Commission, Parliament, Council of Ministers or European Council respectively. There are also ways to change the legislative process to make it easier for citizens to directly engage with EU decision-making, such as the European Citizen’s Initiative.\n<strong>If the current policies of the EU are solely to blame</strong> for Euroscepticism (rather than partly), then the answer may lie in calling for a change in the EU’s stance on austerity. For the Committee on Constitutional Affairs II this implies addressing the way that the EU is framed in the media and by Eurosceptic parties, <em>not </em>proposing specific economic policies. By this logic, reactionary voting to governments might also be linked to Euroscepticism rather than EU policies.\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n\t<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nThe nature of European integration is enshrined in the treaties of the European Union, agreed on unanimously by the heads of Member States, or by their national parliaments. There are thus no measures in place to change the nature of European integration.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere have been multiple attempts to change the way the EU works and to increase direct engagement by citizens. The <strong>European Parliament</strong> has been steadily granted new powers since its inception, and is now co-legislator with the Council since the <strong>Lisbon Treaty</strong> in ‘ordinary legislative procedure’<a href=\"#_ftn21\" name=\"_ftnref21\">[21]</a>. The Lisbon Treaty also introduced the <strong>European Citizen’s Initiative </strong>which allows a minimum of one million citizens from at least seven different countries can call upon the Commission to propose legislation on matters on which the EU has competence (the right) to legislate<a href=\"#_ftn22\" name=\"_ftnref22\">[22]</a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere are also proposals to change aspects of the EU that are especially criticized by Eurosceptic parties, such removing as the European Parliament’s seat in Strasbourg<a href=\"#_ftn23\" name=\"_ftnref23\">[23]</a>.\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n\t<li><strong> Links for further research</strong></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Integration and the ‘ever-closer union’</em>\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>A standard Eurosceptic media article that focuses on the path of European integration.

Crimea’s sovereignty became a key question in the Ukraine crisis as the Russian-backed forces seized control of the peninsula. This was followed by the territory’s large Russian speaking majority voting in a referendum to join Russia on the 16<sup>th</sup> of March; 97% reportedly voted in favour<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a>. This figure was later disputed, and more recent estimates suggest that only 50-60% supported the move. The referendum was deemed illegal by Ukraine and most of the international community. Crimea is seen as the focal point of the crisis, together with the Eastern Ukraine where the fighting continues.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Minsk Agreement </strong>– A ceasefire agreement signed by Ukraine and pro-Russian separatist rebels on the 5th of September 2014, in Minsk, Belarus. The agreement contained 12 points, including but not limited to pulling back heavy guns by at least 15km, allowing international observers and releasing prisoners. However this did not result putting an end to the military clashes in the area, and the accusations from both sides about the violation of the ceasefire continues. The Agreement was proclaimed a failure as it did not manage to establish a lasting ceasefire between the two parties.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Euromaiden </strong>– Refers to a period of civic unrest and series of demonstrations which began on the 21st of November 2013, where the public expressed its dissatisfaction about the Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and his parliament, following Yanukovych’s refusal to sign the Association Agreement which would had resulted in closer ties between Ukraine and the European Union.

The country is struggling at the brink of a civil war with a significant pressure both internally, with the Eastern region facing increased isolation in the hands of the pro-Russian rebels, and outside, with Russia supplying the rebel troops and strengthening its sanctions on imports from Ukraine.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn addition to the severe internal divides, Ukraine has also seen increasing pressure from the Russian side. The Crimean Peninsula has taken the central stage in the conflict: Since Ukraine is seeking closer ties with the Union, this provoked Russia to annex the Crimea Peninsula and pro-Russian rebels in the east seek to establish full control over the Eastern region. During spring 2014, the separatists backed by the pro-Russian troops took over the most important cities of the Eastern counties, namely Luhansk and Donetsk. The news is filled with pictures of “green men”, referring to armed soldiers wearing uniforms very similar to that of the Russian army while Russia continues to deny having sent troops and to be supplying the rebels.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n\n<em>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Source – BBC website, footnote)</em>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe crisis in Ukraine has not only been widely discussed in the international community - it has also prompted a variety of international actors to take action. Many heads of the Member States have been involved in the negotiations for ceasefire. February 2015 saw yet another diplomatic push in order to end the fighting, the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France announcing that the ceasefire will begin on 15<sup>th</sup> of February.

Lead by its president Vladimir Putin, Russia has not only put brakes on Ukraine’s attempts to foster closer ties with the European Union, but it has also denied to be supporting the separatists holding Crimea and Eastern Ukraine under their power.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>International community</strong> – The eyes of the international community are largely concentrated on Ukraine, with hopes of finding a viable solution to the crisis. The US supports the idea of giving defensive but not offensive weapons: they have so far refrained from supplying Ukraine with lethal weaponry, but according to US President Barack Obama this option remains on the table<a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\">[7]</a>:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>NATO</strong> – Ukraine is not a member of NATO, but considering its geographic closeness to countries such as the Baltic States, NATO is keeping a close eye on the developments in the area. Furthermore, NATO has increased its military presence in the surrounding countries following the increase of Russian military presence in Eastern Ukraine.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"6\">\n\t<li><strong> Key conflicts</strong></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Ukraine - Russia relations:</strong> Russia shows clear signals of disapproval of Ukraine seeking closer ties with the EU: on September 12<sup>th</sup>, Russia put brakes on EU and Ukraine trade negotiations resulting in the EU and Ukraine postponing their free-trade agreement to 2016 in exchange for Russia not issuing a trade embargo on Ukraine. However these developments do not contribute to stabilising Ukraine, as Russia’s reply to the sanctions imposed by the EU has included freezing fruit and vegetable imports from Ukraine, claiming “health concerns”.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Russia - EU relations:</strong> Russia’s repeated violation of the sovereignty of the Ukrainian state and its contribution to the increase of violence in the area has prompted the EU to take action against Russia. This has happened, most prominently, in the form of sanctions, with the latest ones being introduced on the 30<sup>th</sup> of January 2015. At the same time, many EU Member States are dependent on the energy imported from Russia (about a quarter of Europe’s gas comes from Russia<a href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\">[8]</a>) and many fear that the sanctions harming Russian economy could potentially create backlash in the form of disruption in the energy supply or in the form of counter sanctions imposed by Russia on EU food imports (as already is the case with Ukraine). Therefore, there are significant disagreements within the Member States about the extent that the Union should get involved in supporting Ukraine, as so far that has meant taking action against Russia.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Ukraine - EU relations:</strong> The protests following the refusal of the Ukrainian government to sign the Association Agreement in the Vilnius summit showed the pro-European sentiment present in Ukraine, however the population is also largely divided over this question. Two years into the crisis and no end in sight, Ukrainians show signs of discontent about the way the EU has handled their side of the talks: The failure of the Minsk agreement and OSCE border monitoring following the Minsk agreement holding little to no value offer very little comfort for the Ukrainian nation tackling the crisis. Furthermore, the responses from Russia’s side to Ukraine’s initiatives to foster a closer bond with EU can be seen to result in making them more sceptical and possibly less likely to enter further agreements.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>EU foreign policy making</strong> – “The EU’s modest diplomatic performance confirms a pattern of avoiding power and responsibility in the conflict.”<a href=\"#_ftn9\" name=\"_ftnref9\">[9]</a> The European Union has often been criticised for not taking swift enough action in the crisis situations, as well as not being firm and efficient enough when doing so: Where else would it be as crucial as when talking about the safety of its borders, as is the case with Ukraine? The Union needs to revise its strategy security wise, and the steps it is ready to take not only diplomatically but also on the security front. What the crisis in Ukraine has highlighted is that the Union’s foreign policy making is still in baby shoes. The Union does not act and speak with a united voice in solving the crisis - instead of Mogherini [the High Representative] and Donald Tusk [Head of the European Commission] it is Angela Merkel [German chancellor] and Francois Hollande [French President] that have been leading the talks in Moscow and Kiev. Even if the cooperation between the EU and the US has been remarkable so far, it has been largely the heads of the Member States communicating with the US, so the link to the EU is not directly to the European but rather to the Member State level. This shows a continuing focus on national stances and undermines the EU’s role as a united foreign policy maker.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"7\">\n\t<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Measures taken by the EU</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFollowing the Russian annexation of Crimea, the Council of European Union has introduced <strong>three waves of restrictive measures</strong> against Russia, enforced in June 23, 2014, December 18, 2014 and January 29, 2015 respectively. The current sanctions policy towards Russia aims at the following targets: private entities and individuals via visa bans and freezes on assets, financial markets by banning long term EU-loans for the five state owned banks, the energy sector through restrictions on Rosneft, Trasneft and Gazprom Neft activities and the defence industry by means of blacklisting Russian ‘dual use’ (civil and military) technology manufacturers, such as the ‘Saiga’ producing Kalashnikov rifles. Furthermore, import and export of arms or related material is subject to embargo.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n(Source of the picture: BBC website)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn addition to sanctions directed to Russia, the EU's humanitarian and early recovery assistance in Ukraine currently amounts to a total of 95 million euros.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Measures taken by the international community </span>\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u00a0</span>\n\n<strong>NATO</strong> has increased its presence in the countries surrounding Ukraine, by building additional military bases and conducting surveillance flights over countries such as Romania and Poland.<a href=\"#_ftn10\" name=\"_ftnref10\">[10]</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe <strong>US </strong>has worked together with the EU to ensure sanctions introduced by the two parties would be compatible with each other. Having so far refrained from supplying lethal weaponry, Obama admits that this is not out of question either. Additionally, Canada and a number of other countries have also introduced various sanctions on Russia.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"8\">\n\t<li><strong> Links for further research</strong></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>EU and the Ukrainian crisis </em>\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li><em>Ukraine in crisis -

A movement to allow sharia to govern personal status law, a set of regulations that pertain to marriage, divorce, inheritance, and custody, is even expanding into the West.<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a></li>\n\t<li><strong>Jihadists</strong> adhere to an extreme interpretation of Sunni Islam and consider themselves the only true believers. In the particular case of ISIL, they hold that the rest of the world is made up of unbelievers who seek to destroy Islam, justifying attacks against other Muslims and non-Muslims alike.</li>\n\t<li><strong>The Sunni Muslims</strong> can mostly be interpreted as the orthodox and traditionalist branch of Islam. The tradition in this case refers to practices based on precedent or reports of the actions of the Prophet Muhammad and those close to him.<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a></li>\n\t<li><strong>The Shia Muslims</strong> believe that following\u00a0the Prophet Muhammad's death, leadership should have passed directly to his cousin/son-in-law,\u00a0Ali bin Abu Talib. Throughout history, Shia Muslims have not recognized the authority of elected Muslim leaders, choosing instead to follow a line of Imams\u00a0which they believe have been appointed by the Prophet Muhammad or God Himself.<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\">[3]</a></li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"2\">\n\t<li><strong> Relevance and explanation of the issue</strong></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\nThe Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has dramatically undermined stability in Iraq, Syria and the broader Middle East and poses a threat to international peace and security. ISIL continues to commit gross, systematic abuses of human rights and violations of international law including indiscriminate killing and deliberate targeting of civilians, mass executions and extrajudicial killings, persecution of individuals and entire communities on the basis of their identity, kidnapping of civilians, forced displacement of Shia communities and minority groups, killing and maiming of children, rape and other forms of sexual violence, along with numerous other atrocities. <a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\">[4]</a>\n\nThe Islamic State’s current military strategy—including its funding, equipment, manpower, and operational capabilities—is much more sophisticated than anything the West has witnessed from similar groups.\nThe militants control huge passages of land, including oil wells, and have large quantities of military hardware and significant financial resources from oil exports, smuggling, extortion, black marketeering and legitimate businesses at its disposal. The ISIL has deepened its roots and undertaken a massive recruitment on religious ideology not only from Iraq and Syria but also from other parts of the globe. Some return to commit terrorist acts in their countries of origin. France and Belgium have suffered horrendous killings perpetrated by returnee jihadists.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe militants conduct a\u00a0massive “marketing” campaign\u00a0that uses all modern means of communication and focuses mainly on Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. With this campaign, the Islamic State pursues three parallel objectives: to threaten and terrorize Western audiences; to disseminate propaganda for recruitment purposes; and to intimidate the populations of territories the group wants to conquer.<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\">[5]</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe main power that ISIL has is that it controls a very large territory, through its ideological supporters and armed fighters. The map below shows the territory division in Iraq and Syria, as well as the areas ISIL had either attacked, controlled or held power over as of January 15<sup>th</sup>.<a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\">[6]</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThink tanks, diplomatic missions and media are widespread with analyses of the ISIL. Recently, some progress has been made in the fight against ISIL, with Kurdish forces making headway and Global Coalition to counter ISIL inflicting the airstrikes in northern Iraq as well as in Syria. After Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh\u00a0was burned to death while been trapped in a cage, Jordan’s interior minister, Hussein al-Majali said security services have a tight grip and are ready to intensify strikes and that this is “the beginning of a continued process to eliminate ISIL and wipe them out completely“.<a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\">[7]</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFrance, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Estonia, Hungary, Belgium and Denmark are Member States that actively take part in countering terrorism in Iraq and Syria through participation in the military provision of the Global Coalition. Sweden, Austria, Switzerland, Ireland, Spain, Slovakia, Norway and Luxemburg, on the other hand, provide humanitarian aid to help those affected by the clashes. <a href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\">[8]</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe EU Civil Protection Mechanism has been activated to support “rapid deployment of in-kind assistance and expertise to Iraq.” The European Commission has increased the level of aid to $22 million in 2014. The EU is determined to stand by Iraq in the fight against terrorism The European Union remains committed to contributing to regional and international efforts to fight ISIL and other terrorist groups that threaten regional and global stability. The European Commission wants to invest another €1 billion of aid in Iraq and Syria over the next two years as part of a broader effort to counter ISIL. Much of the new money will go to humanitarian aid that is mostly directed at international and European NGOs working inside Syria and Iraq, and the related refugee crisis.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEU High Representative Federica Mogherini attended the first ministerial level meeting of the Global Coalition to counter ISIL, which was held at the invitation of U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in Brussels on 3 December 2014.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe EU has been actively engaging Qatari and Saudi Arabia authorities on the fight against terrorism, and positively notes both countries' engagement in the international coalition against ISIL. In this context, preventing the direct or indirect financing of terrorist groups by individuals and charities from Gulf countries has been a key concern for the\u00a0EU.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFurthermore, there is no question that Global Coalition should do what it can to minimize civilian casualties, but they are fighting an asymmetric war against a movement that does not wear uniforms, may or may not mark its vehicles, and can draw on decades of experience in regional conflicts where irregular forces have used civilians as human shields.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo cope with those aspects of the situation that are pressing and relevant to Europe, Global Coalition and EU leaders must focus their efforts on five key areas: counterterrorism cooperation, the interruption of financial flows to ISIL, humanitarian assistance, political dialogue, and long-term policy reforms.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"3\">\n\t<li><strong> Key questions</strong></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>In light of the establishment of Global Coalition to tackle the ISIL threat, how and to what extent should partaking countries utilize military action as a means to overcome radical islamism and other extremist ideologies?</li>\n\t<li>In addition to existing measures stemming from security concerns, can and should do the EU still aspire to develop a political response, with a view to assisting the establishment of a free and open society in Syria and Iraq?</li>\n\t<li>What steps must be taken to build up \u00a0on the common EU strategy to counter ISIL, in terms of existing Common Security and Defense Policy the EU Counter Terrorism Strategy?</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"4\">\n\t<li><strong> Key facts and figures</strong></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>ISIL is estimated to have between 20,000 and 31,000 fighters, well known for their brutality.<a href=\"#_ftn9\" name=\"_ftnref9\">[9]</a></li>\n\t<li>ISIL raises approximately $2 million a day from oil sales, taxes extortion and smuggling; the entirety of its funds are estimated to be around $2 billion.<sup> <a href=\"#_ftn10\" name=\"_ftnref10\">[10]</a></sup></li>\n\t<li>ISIL and its allies control about 40,000 sq km of Iraq and Syria - roughly the size of Belgium; however, including Mosul, Tikrit, Falluja and Tal Afar in Iraq; Raqqa in Syria - oil fields, dams, main roads and border crossings the overall territory under ISIL control is closer to 90,000 sq km.<a href=\"#_ftn11\" name=\"_ftnref11\">[11]</a></li>\n\t<li>The Soufan Group recently estimated that more than 12,000 foreign nationals from at least 81 countries are fighting among ISIL ranks.

ISIL also has ambitions pertaining to the remaining parts of Iraq and Syria that are not currently under its control.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>The Persian Gulf countries</strong>, such as the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar,\u00a0Kuwait and Jordan are naturally directly affected by ISIL activity in the region because of their geographical proximity. So far, they have created task forces to tackle the ISIL threat, as well as conducted missions and airstrikes to protect their borders and help stop ISIL from expanding.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>The United States of America </strong>as the leader of the Global Anti-ISIL Coalition<a href=\"#_ftn15\" name=\"_ftnref15\">[15]</a>, has acted on the invitation of Iraqi government as the main actor on the field in terms of military supply and military support, assessment of Iraqi forces and the threat ISIL poses. For decades, the United States has pursued a set of core interests in the region: countering terrorism and stopping the spread of nuclear weapons, securing the free flow of commerce and safeguarding the security of the region. On November 7th, 2014 President Obama\u00a0asked\u00a0Congress for an additional $5.6 billion to fight ISIL and authorized 1,500 more troops to be deployed in non-combat roles against ISIL in Iraq, bringing the total number above 3,000. <a href=\"#_ftn16\" name=\"_ftnref16\">[16]</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>The European Union</strong> has committed more than $200 million in humanitarian assistance to Iraq and Syria and \u00a0is managing aid from the <strong>Member States, </strong>who have divided into military provision, aid support and general support to defeat ISIL. <a href=\"#_ftn17\" name=\"_ftnref17\">[17]</a>\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n\t<li><strong> Key conflicts</strong></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\nThe first conflict can be classified as an internal one, where Sunni Muslim members of ISIL are fighting against the government of Iraq, and their Shia supporters. Also fighting back against the Islamic State are the Kurds<a href=\"#_ftn18\" name=\"_ftnref18\">[18]</a>, who are defending and even expanding their grip on parts of the north against the resurgent Sunni-led extremists. The revival of such sectarian-based groups, some with close ties to Iran, sharpens the cultural fault lines that have long prevented Iraq from developing an inclusive government demanded by the United States and its international partners, though the problem now spills past the Iraqi border.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe second issue is that ISIL is presenting as a direct threat to bordering countries with its clear message of expansion around the Middle East. Cooperation between these countries would benefit their shared interests in defeating ISIL and strengthening their borders, but has not been particularly durable, and they continue to act individually.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA long-standing concern in the region, particularly for America, has been energy security. Now, ensuring supply and guaranteeing that Persian Gulf oil doesn’t fall into unfriendly hands — or stop flowing entirely — is a core interest for as long as America and the world are dependent on hydrocarbons.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nUnfortunately, the strategy of the Global Coalition is more a rough draft than the planned and thoroughly thought through tactics which the world demands. There has not been a single strategic decision on how to bring stability to the regions where ISIL been defeated, and little is known about the support of the rebels by local civilians living in the occupied areas.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMore unfortunately, the EU, as one of the biggest world actors, has not been responsive to the threat posed by ISIL. As a champion of democracy and human rights, the EU should help Iraq and Syria in building a democratic society, and indeed, on February 6<sup>th</sup> Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs called for the establishment of a comprehensive strategy in tackling the crisis in Iraq and Syria.<a href=\"#_ftn19\" name=\"_ftnref19\">[19]</a> The main question remains what should this strategy include? \u00a0What more apart from humanitarian aid and Member States’ contributions the EU is able to offer in terms of its foreign policy?\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"7\">\n\t<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>The Global Coalition to counter ISIL</strong> was created in September 2013, is led by the US and includes sixty partner countries. Coalition partners reaffirmed their commitment to work together under a common, multifaceted, and long-term strategy to degrade and defeat ISIL on December 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2014 while meeting in Brussels. Participants decided that the efforts of the global coalition should focus on multiple lines of effort:\n<ol>\n\t<li>Supporting military operations, capacity building and training;</li>\n\t<li>Stopping the flow of foreign terrorist fighters;</li>\n\t<li>Cutting off ISIL's access to financing and funding;</li>\n\t<li>Addressing associated humanitarian relief and crises;</li>\n\t<li>Exposing ISIL’s true nature.<a href=\"#_ftn20\" name=\"_ftnref20\">[20]</a></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>The EU counter-terrorism strategy targeting radical Islamists </strong>includes more stringent controls on EU citizens leaving and entering the Schengen free travel zone, an air passenger registry to check the movement of suspected Islamist militants and fresh cyber-security measures aimed at intercepting suspect traffic, better information sharing for \"identification of travel routes of terrorism\" and the adoption of \u00a0\"an EU-wide system for sharing details of air passengers\".\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>EUJUST LEX</strong> was a civil crisis management operation implemented under the auspices of the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), which aimed to strengthen the Iraqi criminal justice system. This mission formed part of the EU’s contribution towards the reconstruction and the emergence of a stable, secure and democratic Iraq. EUJUST LEX began on 1\u00a0July 2005. The mission was extended a number of times; but the last extension lapsed at the end of 2013.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"8\">\n\t<li><strong> Links for further research</strong></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>The European Union Bodies and Policies on Foreign Affairs</em>\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>The Common Security and Defense Policy Overview</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1424347961808&amp;uri=URISERV:25010101_1\">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1424347961808&amp;uri=URISERV:25010101_1</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.eeas.europa.eu/csdp/about-csdp/index_en.htm\">http://www.eeas.europa.eu/csdp/about-csdp/index_en.htm</a>\n<ul>\n\t<li>The European Union Counter Terrorism Strategy</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://register.consilium.europa.eu/doc/srv?l=EN&amp;f=ST%2014469%202005%20REV%204\">http://register.consilium.europa.eu/doc/srv?l=EN&amp;f=ST%2014469%202005%20REV%204</a>\n<ul>\n\t<li>The European Union External Action</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://www.eeas.europa.eu/what_we_do/index_en.htm\">http://www.eeas.europa.eu/what_we_do/index_en.htm</a>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Council of the EU: Council conclusions on counter-terrorism</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2015/02/150209-council-conclusions-counter-terrorism/\">http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2015/02/150209-council-conclusions-counter-terrorism/</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>The EU on countering ISIL</em>\n\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Joint Communication to the European Parliament and the Council: Elements for an EU regional strategy for Syria and Iraq as well as the Da'esh threat</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/news/20150206_JOIN_en.pdf\">http://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/news/20150206_JOIN_en.pdf</a>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Council on Foreign Policy: The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/iraq/islamic-state-iraq-syria/p14811\">http://www.cfr.org/iraq/islamic-state-iraq-syria/p14811</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>The history of ISIL and its intentions</em>\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>What ISIL really wants?</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/02/what-isis-really-wants/384980/\">http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/02/what-isis-really-wants/384980/</a>\n<ul>\n\t<li>BBC: Battle for Iraq and Syria in maps</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-27838034\">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-27838034</a>\n<ul>\n\t<li>The World Post: You Can't Understand ISIS If You Don't Know the History of Wahhabism in Saudi Arabia</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alastair-crooke/isis-wahhabism-saudi%20arabia_b_5717157.html?utm_hp_ref=world\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alastair-crooke/isis-wahhabism-saudi arabia_b_5717157.html?utm_hp_ref=world</a>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Middle East Security Report 21: The Islamic State: a Counter-Strategy for a Counter State</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Lewis-Center%20of%20gravity.pdf\">http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Lewis-Center%20of%20gravity.pdf</a>\n<ul>\n\t<li>EU Business: The EU and the Middle East</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://www.eubusiness.com/regions/middle-east\">http://www.eubusiness.com/regions/middle-east</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Other sources</em>\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik Comments: The Case for a European Defence Review</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://www.swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/comments/2012C24_dkw.pdf\">http://www.swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/comments/2012C24_dkw.pdf</a>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Washington Institute: Countering ISIL Financing: A Realistic Assessment</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/other/LevittStatement20150202-v3.pdf\">https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/other/LevittStatement20150202-v3.pdf</a>\n<ul>\n\t<li>War on two fronts: the EU perspective on the foreign terrorist fighters of ISIL by Teemu Sinkkonen</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://www.fiia.fi/assets/publications/bp166.pdf\">www.fiia.fi/assets/publications/bp166.pdf</a>\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\"><em><strong>[1]</strong></em></a><em> Council on Foreign Relations: Islam: Governing under Sharia \u00a0<a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/religion/islam-governing-under-sharia/p8034\">http://www.cfr.org/religion/islam-governing-under-sharia/p8034</a></em>\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\"><em><strong>[2]</strong></em></a> <em>BBC: Sunnis and Shias: Islam's ancient schism </em><em><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-16047709\">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-16047709</a></em>\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref3\" name=\"_ftn3\"><em><strong>[3]</strong></em></a><em> About religion: What’s the difference between Shia and Sunni Muslims?

It is built upon two pillars, the first one concerning the economic impact of agriculture<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a> and the second one addressing the competitiveness of and social welfare in rural areas.<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a></li>\n\t<li><strong>Rural Development Policy (RDP) </strong>– This second pillar of the CAP, developed per seven year period (2007-13 and 2014-20). It especially aims at reducing the gap between more and less developed Member States when it comes to agricultural profits.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Single Farm Payments (SFP) </strong>– It is a system of subsidies paid to the farmers in order to boost their production and encourage them to take further steps in their rural business. The payment is assigned on per-hectar basis and not on the type of cultivated crops.<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\">[3]</a></li>\n\t<li><strong>Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) </strong>– Based on the SFP, the BPS allocates payments to farmers when they apply for the first year and it has to be renewed by them from the second year on. The BPS is structured in green direct payments, redistributive payments, payments for young farmers and payments for areas with natural or other constraints.<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\">[4]</a></li>\n\t<li><strong>Capping </strong>– The name given to the process according to which Member States are implementing the CAP and its latest reforms, especially the BPS.</li>\n\t<li><strong>European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development </strong>– It is the financial instrument simplifying the implementation of the RDP and managing this policy throughout its seven year duration.<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\">[5]</a></li>\n\t<li><strong>Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-20 </strong>– This framework regulates the EU budget and all the areas fundings should be assigned to. Therefore, it also establishes the amount of money assigned to agriculture and rural development, including the one assigned to BPS</li>\n\t<li><strong>Europe 2020 </strong>– A ten-year strategy aiming at a more suistainable growth of the Member States, also encourages the development of all sectors and the creation of new job opportunities.<a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\">[6]</a> The increasing of sustainability and jobs in the rural production goes hand in hand with the goals set by this strategy.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n\t<li><strong> Relevance and explanation of the issue</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n\nWhen it comes to thinking about economic development and where its basis resides, agriculture is rarely among European citizens’ thoughts. The rural sector has always had a crucial impact on the EU’s economy. Since 1957, the EU has underlined the importance of agriculture as one of the leading sectors of its economy and established the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Its main goals were increasing productivity by promoting technical progress and ensuring an availability of supplies for every citizen at reasonable prices. However, considering the great variety of farming techniques, mostly due to different climates and traditions, the EU always struggled to find a balance between the economies of its Member States, especially when it comes to protecting the producers’ interests.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis has always been a very challenging issue for the EU, especially taking into account the enlargement of its borders and subsequently less homogeneous agricultural yields. On the one hand, there are more arable territories; on the other hand, new countries have different needs and often less stable conditions in terms of rural development. For example, the newMember States focus on improving their infrastructure, while the more developed ones are investing in advanced technologies that can maximise their profits. Furthermore the primary sector, encompassing mainly agriculture, decreases as industrialization increases, which puts the EU in the difficult position to keep a sector bigger than it would normally be according to market rules. These factors hinder the competitiveness of European agriculture as a whole because there does not seem to be a common way for all Member States to enhance the profits of this sector.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"3\">\n\t<li><strong> Key questions</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>How can the EU make sure that all Member States reach the RDP goals by 2020, considering the different stances of the national governments towards the new CAP?</li>\n\t<li>Can the Basic Payment Scheme effectively reduce the gap between the Member States when it comes to rural development and agricultural profits stability?</li>\n\t<li>How can the EU encourage farmers to use more environmental friendly technology that can help in working towards a more sustainable agricultural sector when it comes to both production techniques and amount of goods produced?</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"4\">\n\t<li><strong> Key facts and figures</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>The rural areas fully used for agriculture in 2012 were 174.499.000 hectars. France is the Member State with the highest output in this area.</li>\n\t<li>Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Poland and Portugal are the countries where more than 15% of the working population has a job in the agricultural business, while the United Kingdom, Belgium and Luxemburg have the lowest share, below 1,5%.<a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\">[7]</a></li>\n\t<li>Denmark will apply the Basic Payments (BP) system only to some of its regions, especially on diary production, while Ireland and Italy will most likely switch to national level.<a href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\">[8]</a></li>\n\t<li>In 2010, the agricultural sector represented 0.61% of the EU’s GDP. This figure is expected to decrease to 0.33% by 2020.<a href=\"#_ftn9\" name=\"_ftnref9\">[9]</a></li>\n\t<li>The EU was the biggest exporter of agricultural products in 2013, reaching €120 billion. During the same year, the trade surplus of the EU increased by 7% and the most exported are wine, milk and cereals.<a href=\"#_ftn10\" name=\"_ftnref10\">[10]</a></li>\n\t<li>Agriculture covers 47% of the EU’s territory and up to 70% of the European species; both livestock and vegetables are unfavourably preserved or conserved, making it necessary to reduce the use of pesticides and to adopt greener and more sustainable measures.<a href=\"#_ftn11\" name=\"_ftnref11\">[11]</a></li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n\t<li><strong> Key actors</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nThe EU Commission’s <strong>Directorate General (DG) for Agriculture and Rural Development</strong> aims to promote rural sector development in accordance with the goals set by Europe 2020. It promotes the implementation of the CAP to achieve viable food production, the management of natural resources and climate action as well as the balanced territorial development. The European Commission mainly focuses in the stability of the agricultural income and the necessity for the reduction of rural poverty and the growth of rural employment.<a href=\"#_ftn12\" name=\"_ftnref12\">[12]</a>\n\nDuring the next seven years, the DG will also tackle gas emmissions and try to protect the biodiversity of the EU’s soil. The ‘greening of the CAP’ becomes, therefore, one of the most important goals to reach by 2020, also due to its connection with other EU frameworks and projects aimed at a more sustainable economic and industrial growth such as the EU Emission Trading Scheme.<a href=\"#_ftn13\" name=\"_ftnref13\">[13]</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe Member States are encouraged to follow the capping process as much and as quick as possible in order to reach the goals of the RDP. However, the different economies, and the state of development and scientific research, which is lower in the south of Europe and higher in the Northern countries, makes the objectives of the RDP 2014-2020 very difficult to be fulfilled. The Member States’ goverments have the freedom to decide if they want to implement the CAP immediately at national level or to start renewating the rural sector from those regions that are more productive or better disposed to such reforms. Member States get grants if they actively engage in fostering the rural sector competitiveness, the sustainable development and in taking actions for a greener agriculture, which is also beneficial in the fight against climate change.<a href=\"#_ftn14\" name=\"_ftnref14\">[14]</a>\nFarmers are a key target of the CAP, especially when it comes to the different BPS grants that can be allocated to them. The new CAP gives even more importance to young farmers who are willing to establish a strong enterpreneurial career in this sector. Nowadays, youngsters are faced with entry barriers, hindering both the development of food security and innovation in agriculture and the increasing of job opportunities and better social conditions in the countryside.<a href=\"#_ftn15\" name=\"_ftnref15\">[15]</a> Moreover, the needs for both small and big producers lay in the different BPs that can be allocated to them as they are starting to actively fulfil the conditions the CAP is imposing as grant criteria. The farmers’ main concerns revolve around the greening aspect of the new CAP, which can strongly affect the choice of the grown crops and the final income.<a href=\"#_ftn16\" name=\"_ftnref16\">[16]</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlong with climate change, economic crisis, diffused unemployment, the consumers’ needs were also taken into consideration for the lastest development of the CAP. Consumers dietary habits also changed over the years, favouring a shift towards healthier food. For this reason organic food value on the market increased in the past years; more than 70% of Europeans trust it<a href=\"#_ftn17\" name=\"_ftnref17\">[17]</a> and a they also believe it is safer due to the reduction of pesticides’ and other polluting agents’ usage.\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n\t<li><strong> Key conflicts</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nThe implementation of the CAP at European level is very problematic due to the different stages of economic, scientific and technical development of the different EU countries as well as their social welfare.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe CAP has also earned some critics from a wide number of Member States, believing that BPS slows down the economic development and hinders the majority of European countries from exporting the goods produced.<a href=\"#_ftn18\" name=\"_ftnref18\">[18]</a> Sweden in particular has been the first country that took a strong position against this reform, underlining the loss of competitiveness of the European agricultural sector brought by the BPS and the damage that this may cause to smaller farms compared to the big industrialised ones. Moreover, the UK has always raised its doubts about the discrepancies in CAP funding. While France receives consistent benefits from this policy, countries such as the UK do not get the same amount of grants and their farmers perceive this as unfair.<a href=\"#_ftn19\" name=\"_ftnref19\">[19]</a> Ireland is, for instance, one of the countries that will benefit the most from the new CAP since the rural land area is limited and the new reform is aimed at boosting its productivity to the maximum.<a href=\"#_ftn20\" name=\"_ftnref20\">[20]</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnother issue is related to the difference between the big and small farms’ potential, as larger profits breed development. While big farms are able to implement new technologies due to their profit margin, the new CAP tends to help those smaller rural activities that can also preserve biodiversity and help with the greening strategy. However, while the former are able to invest in new methods, the latter are refrained from doing so due their higher costs and difficulty in their implementation.<a href=\"#_ftn21\" name=\"_ftnref21\">[21]</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"7\">\n\t<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nThe EU established the CAP in 1957 and this policy is still the only one regulating the agriculture inside its borders. However, considering the development of modern technologies and the ever changing capacity of the Member States’ economies, a wide number of reforms have been made to keep up to date with the needs of European consumers and producers.<a href=\"#_ftn22\" name=\"_ftnref22\">[22]</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn 2003 a fundamental reform of the CAP encouraged the farmers to take a more entrepreneurial view of their activities and shape them according to the market needs, raising the competitiveness of this sector in the worldwide economy. The main point of this reform consisted in introducing the Single Farm Payments (SFP), assigning subsidies to farmers according to environmental quality, food safety and animal welfare standards. Nowadays the CAP has provided every MS with the possibility to choose either to receive the SFP at a local or a regional level, increasing the flexibility of the implemented measures as well as animal welfare and environmental conditions on the territory.<a href=\"#_ftn23\" name=\"_ftnref23\">[23]</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAgriculture is also present in the fundamental points of the Multiannual Financial Framework for the next seven years. Thus, the CAP will be reinforced to achieve a more modern and greener policy. This will contribute to achieve the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy,<a href=\"#_ftn24\" name=\"_ftnref24\">[24]</a> such as unlocking potential production in rural areas, developing local markets and jobs, accompanying the restructuring of agriculture and supporting farmers' income to maintain a sustainable agricultural sector throughout Europe. The most recent reform to the CAP started in 2007 and only in 2013 it was possible to reach an agreement for the future of the EU agriculture, the main target being the Rural Development of the EU agriculture.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe new CAP builds on the main pillars of the old one and provides a new design for the SFP, the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS).<a href=\"#_ftn25\" name=\"_ftnref25\">[25]</a> The most important characteristic is that it is subjected to “cross compliance” <a href=\"#_ftn26\" name=\"_ftnref26\">[26]</a> balancing the respect of environmental and animal welfare and the economies for the Member States. The BPS, which is now fully implemented, has the aim of reducing the discrepancies among the different regions of the Member States and the gap between the European countries. Moreover, a policy of “greening” is highly stressed and the European Commission is proposing to spend 30% of BP specifically to improve the use of natural resources in the soil and to support those farmers who are willing to keep up with criteria that are necessary to get this greening payment.<a href=\"#_ftn27\" name=\"_ftnref27\">[27]</a> In order to attract youngsters to the rural sector, the new Commission proposed to allocate a BP with an additional 25% for the first five years of activities to those EU citizens who are not more that forty years old and are willing to start a farming business.<a href=\"#_ftn28\" name=\"_ftnref28\">[28]</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLast but not least the EU intends to enhance the production rate of small farms, whose role is fundamental for mantaining the biodiversity of both natural resources and products. The Rural Development Policy for 2014-2020 is based on the latest reform of the CAP and it aims at facilitating producer cooperation, reducing production costs, enhancing scientific research on new technologies and protecting the environment. The RDP encourages the Member States to build their own rural production on at least four out of six of the following targets by 2020, including the sharing of knowledge on new innovative plans for agriculture, competitiveness of the rural sector and social inclusion in the less developed areas.<a href=\"#_ftn29\" name=\"_ftnref29\">[29]</a>\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol

				Overview = "<h2>Committee on Climate Change (Clim)</h2>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nChairperson: Ciara Robinson (UK)\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong> Key terms</strong></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Global warming </strong>– the rising temperatures caused by an increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the earth’s atmosphere that captures solar radiation and retains heat in greater capacity. This has mostly been caused by anthropogenic activities, especially since industrialisation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Greenhouse Gases </strong>– A gas that contributes to the greenhouse effect by absorbing infrared radiation. Carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons are examples of greenhouse gases.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Emissions Trading System (ETS) </strong>– The EU ETS works on the 'cap and trade' principle. A limit<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a> is set on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases (GHGs) that can be emitted by the factories, power plants and other installations in the system. The cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. Within the cap, companies receive or buy emission allowances<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\"><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a>, which they can trade with one another as needed.<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\"><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a></li>\n\t<li><strong>Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC)</strong> – the founding principle in the Kyoto Protocol whereby more industrialised and developed countries who have historically emitted more GHGs are to be held accountable for this by having binding targets and pledging financial support to developing states. Meanwhile, developing states are not bound by any such targets since they have not historically emitted as much and this would halt their economic development or the ability to address issues associated with the development process.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"2\">\n\t<li><strong> Relevance and explanation of the issue</strong></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>“Climate change does not respect borders, it does not respect who you are - rich and poor, small and big,\" <strong>Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations</strong></em>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe threat of climate change is real. Nation-states and their representatives agree on this much. Whilst some would argue that the effects still remain uncertain, it is clear that global warming will contribute to sea-level rise, the melting of glaciers, spread of disease, food scarcity, coastal flooding and extreme weather<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\"><sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></a>. These effects will have the greatest impact in the southern hemisphere but present a global obstacle to growth, human safety and the quality of life for citizens.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is not however a new phenomenon but an issue which has been heavily debated for over two decades. Global negotiations began in 1992 with the creation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the international environmental treaty. This brought climate change onto the international agenda and began setting emission reduction targets. The <strong>Kyoto Protocol</strong> of 1997, which came into action in 2005, committed parties to binding reduction targets across two periods. The first was from 2005 to 2013, with the aim of reducing emissions to 5% below 1990 levels. The second, from 2013 to 2020, set a reduction of 18%, however not all of the original parties signed on for the second period. The Kyoto Protocol also established the <strong>CBDR-RC principle.</strong> This received serious criticism on the basis that:\n<ul>\n\t<li>climate change is a universal problem,</li>\n\t<li>some developing countries are major emitters,</li>\n\t<li>developed countries should not be held accountable for previous emissions,</li>\n\t<li>proactive solutions should be implemented by all.</li>\n</ul>\nAs a result,\u00a0 whilst the Kyoto Protocol was supposed to set a stricter framework for climate change prevention, it failed to actively engage all states, including many major emitters, and thus failed as a comprehensive agreement.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSince then, various conferences have taken place. The core issue of these negotiations is establishing what role countries should take, understanding their various capacities to achieve targets, the impact this may have on economic and social development as well as who, historically speaking, has contributed the most to climate change. These are questions that continue to be heavily debated and often, the lack of agreement amongst states reduces the efficiency and applicability of any settlement produced.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe EU has thus far set a precedent in such negotiations by producing ambitious targets, implementing the ETS and placing environmental issues high on its agenda. Having signed the Kyoto Protocol, committed to its second phase and delivered the greatest amount of overseas climate aid, the EU has undertaken significant efforts. With Lima in mind and in the lead up to Paris, the question now remains as to what role the EU should take in encouraging ambitious targets for other countries, continuing to set their own and how a universal and binding agreement can be agreed upon.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"3\">\n\t<li><strong> Key questions</strong></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>How can the EU achieve its 40% domestic emissions reduction target?</li>\n\t<li>What type of agreement should be sought at the Paris conference? Should it be binding, universal, non-binding or transnational?</li>\n\t<li>How can the EU encourage other major economies and emitters to set ambitious targets for emissions reduction?</li>\n\t<li>What approach should the EU take towards developing countries and the future of their environmental programmes?</li>\n\t<li>What realistic impact can the EU have on climate negotiations?</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"4\">\n\t<li><strong> Key facts and figures</strong></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which includes more than 1,300 scientists from the United States and other countries, forecasts a temperature rise of 2.5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century.<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\"><sup><sup>[5]</sup></sup></a></li>\n\t<li>China, the US and India are the top three major emitters of GHGs respectively.<a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\"><sup><sup>[6]</sup></sup></a></li>\n\t<li>President Obama announced a new target to cut net greenhouse gas emissions 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025.<a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\"><sup><sup>[7]</sup></sup></a></li>\n\t<li>President Xi Jinping of China announced targets to peak CO<sub>2</sub> emissions around 2030, with the intention to try to peak early, and to increase the non-fossil fuel share of all energy to around 20 percent by 2030. <a href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\"><sup><sup>[8]</sup></sup></a></li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"5\">\n\t<li><strong> Key actors</strong></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\n<em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">EU institutions:</span></em>\n\n<strong>The European Commission </strong>in coordination with Member States is largely responsible for setting the environmental agenda and particularly enforcing it. It can appeal to the European Court of Justice against Member States who are failing to achieve their commitments. However, mostly positive incentives (such as subsidies) or expert assistance is provided to aid failing Member States. This is led by the <strong>European Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy</strong>, Miguel Arias Cañete, who represents the EU at the <strong>Conferences of Parties (COPs)</strong>. The proposals produced are also debated by the <strong>European Parliament </strong>and the <strong>Council of the European Union</strong> during the ordinary legislative procedure. In March, the <strong>European Council </strong>and heads of state will also meet to discuss the current proposals for the Paris agreement and to confirm the action plan of the EU for 2030.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSince the environment is a shared competence,<strong> Member States </strong>play an important role in the decision making process towards setting goals. This means depending on their intentions and level of commitment, they may wish to alter the targets set or lobby other countries to either set more ambitious or less ambitious targets. This has been the case with the UK and renewable energies. Furthermore, where EU legislation does not provide set steps or rules, Member States can legislate as they please and adopt a variety of different policies with regard to climate change.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Transnational initiatives, organisations and NGOs </strong>including Horizon 2020, the Ellen MacArthur foundation and many more are crucial for research and development as well as lobbying for change in European proposals. These can often set a precedent for new green technologies or environmentally friendly schemes. How the EU wishes to support these, consider their views or capitalise on their successes can influence the EU climate agenda which has been criticised for focusing too much on reducing GHGs and not enough on adaptation methods.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>The European Environmental Agency (EEA) </strong>provides information and research on environmental issues within the EU. It works in coordination with governments from Member States as well as Commission representatives and scientists. This is important in monitoring the progress of Member States, evaluating current policy and informing the public.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>National governments outside the EU </strong>are particularly important in reaching a binding universal agreement. The <strong>United States, India, Russia and China</strong> are major players in the negotiations as significant emitters of GHG but that is not to say that other countries do not also make a significant impact. Sharing knowledge, cooperating with and adapting to their agenda is part of the EU’s aim toward a comprehensive settlement.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe <strong>United Nations </strong>is the leading body for negotiations. Any proposals to change environmental law or suggestions in the lead up to Paris will be submitted to the United Nations Environment Programme at the next COP. Any changes or new approaches accepted will be adopted under the UNFCCC (the environmental treaty of the UN).\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"6\">\n\t<li><strong> Key conflicts</strong></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\nThe first and most basic question is whether an internationally binding agreement should be the basis for future programmes addressing climate change. Whilst the international agenda has historically attempted to do this, it has somewhat failed. The Kyoto Protocol was signed by very few and lost members during its second phase. The top three major emitters (China, the USA and India) either did not ratify the agreement or the agreement had little effect on their environment policies. Many politicians have argued that a binding agreement is simply not feasible as countries, for various reasons (economic, development, societal), do not want to commit to such an agenda. In the lead up to Paris, countries will submit their own targets based on the characteristics of their countries and their respective capabilities with regards to available resources and levels of development. However, despite the apparent progression, that does not mean that this approach guarantees ratification. As seen in previous conferences, an optimistic outlook can be undermined by severe disagreements that continue to define negotiations. Would an international agreement based on supporting transnational initiatives and non-binding agreements be more feasible? This however, would lack enforcement and considering the urgency of climate change, poses many risks to how quickly the problem can be addressed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe second issue with current negotiations is determining who is responsible for what. This discussion has dominated the debate since the introduction of CBDR-RC. To what extent are developed countries expected to shoulder the burden of climate change considering their historical emissions? Practically speaking, this translates into encouraging all countries to set ambitious targets and then implement them. For example, with the USA and China having pledged emission reductions, the EU as a leader in climate change has the opportunity to contribute to proposals made by these countries. This will require reviewing the Multilateral Assessment scheme and proposing changes, if necessary, to the INDCs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe EU’s individual contribution is another area of conflict. The current 2030 targets have been criticised for being too modest but some Member States actually fought to water down such targets<a href=\"#_ftn9\" name=\"_ftnref9\"><sup><sup>[9]</sup></sup></a>. Currently, scientists believe the aim of keeping temperature increase below 2 degrees celsius is unrealistic.<a href=\"#_ftn10\" name=\"_ftnref10\"><sup><sup>[10]</sup></sup></a> The debate remains whether the EU should reconsider its GHG reduction targets.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFurthermore, the target for renewables has also been considered weak as Germany, the EU’s largest economy, has already planned a large shift from nuclear to renewables<a href=\"#_ftn11\" name=\"_ftnref11\"><sup><sup>[11]</sup></sup></a>. Could this in fact be increased? If all Member States are to actively support a shift to renewables, perhaps a more ambitious target could be set. This would also avoid the free-rider problem associated with some Member States who are failing to achieve their targets. This includes 11 Member States who have fallen short of their non-ETS emission reduction targets.<a href=\"#_ftn12\" name=\"_ftnref12\"><sup><sup>[12]</sup></sup></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnother area of discussion is how the EU can support transnational initiatives such as the Horizon 2020 project or independent initiatives such as LSE cities. These are developing at fast rates and often make a significant difference on the regional and consumer level. It is uncertain how and to what extent the EU should support such initiatives and whether these could be incorporated into their targets or commitments in the international arena.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nUltimately, the committee has to face disagreements with regard to the wider international agreements and the INDC submitted by the EU for the next phase of climate action.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"7\">\n\t<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\n<em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">International measures</span></em>\n\nVarious <strong>COPs </strong>have occurred since the Kyoto Protocol to discuss the success of climate agreements and progress. Whilst amendments have been made and countries pledged emission reductions in the <strong>2009 Copenhagen Accord,</strong> the biggest turning point occurred in <strong>Lima, Peru </strong>in<strong> November 2014. </strong>In effect, the negotiations recognised the need for a more comprehensive and binding agreement that was not so rigidly split between developed and developing nations. Countries have now been given the chance to submit<strong> Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs)</strong> comprised of emission pledges, funding and proposals for change. These are intended to be implemented after the final phase of Kyoto. Lima also made progress in the pledging of more than 10 billion dollars by developed and developing countries to the<strong> Green Climate Fund (GCF)<a href=\"#_ftn13\" name=\"_ftnref13\"><sup><strong><sup>[13]</sup></strong></sup></a></strong>. Furthermore, the introduction of the <strong>Multilateral Assessment </strong>scheme to increase transparency and question countries about their emission targets. Furthermore, this elevated adaptation to the same level as mitigation, recognising that<strong> National Adaptation Plans (NAPs)</strong> are needed for state resilience to climate change.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">EU measures</span></em>\n\nThe EU has three climate change programmes:\n\nThe <strong>2020 Climate and Energy Package</strong> is a piece of legislation requiring the EU to achieve a 20% reduction in GHGs, a 20% increase in renewable energy sources and a 20% improvement in the EU’s energy efficiency. These goals are still to be achieved with five main policy areas: promoting green growth, developing the Emissions Trading System (ETS), annual national targets for non-ETS emissions, national renewable energy targets and carbon capture and storage. These targets are also linked to Research and Development programmes such as Horizon 2020 that enable initiatives or projects to receive support from European funds or organisations.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>The 2030 Framework for Climate and Energy Policies </strong>has four main goals:<a href=\"#_ftn14\" name=\"_ftnref14\"><sup><sup>[14]</sup></sup></a>\n<ul>\n\t<li>reduce GHG emissions by 40% compared to 1990 levels.</li>\n\t<li>increase renewable energy by 27%</li>\n\t<li>increase energy efficiency by 27%</li>\n\t<li>reform the ETS and create a more competitive and sustainable energy economy.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>The 2050 Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe</strong> has highlighted broader aims to move to an economy mostly free from GHG emissions based on green technologies and intelligent use of energy. This incorporates expanding the green economy, resource efficiency in various sectors but with particular reference to transport, buildings and industrial production.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThese three programmes will have to be reviewed in order for the EU to submit its INDC before the Paris conference. The question remains, what targets should be set, how will they be implemented and could they play an active role outside of Europe?\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"8\">\n\t<li><strong> Links for further

With one in four people in the developing world living on less than $1.25, it is no wonder that 83% of EU citizens believe it is essential that we continue to support the developing world in sustainable growth. When the goal of halving developing world poverty by 2010 was achieved, this proved that EU action is necessary to aid the growth of developing countries; however there must be a way to improve the EU’s huge financial contributions effectiveness.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs the Millennium Goals have shown a mixed rate of achievement, 2015 is the year to outline the post 2015 framework, a new Cotonou framework and properly delve into the potentials of both donation and investment in order to achieve sustainable and lasting growth in the developing world.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"3\">\n\t<li><strong> Key questions</strong></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>Does it make sense to both donate and invest to the same developing countries?</li>\n\t<li>How best can the EU ensure that private funding is achieving sustainable development?</li>\n\t<li>How best should we move forward in light of the Millennium Development Goals and towards sustainable development goals in a broader post-2015 development agenda?</li>\n\t<li>Can the EU have an input into the investments made by private companies, and should they?</li>\n\t<li>Is the future of sustainable development in investment or donation?</li>\n\t<li>What focus should the post 2015 framework take in order to make more achievable yet still ambitious goals?</li>\n\t<li>What should the post Cotonou framework contain?</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"4\">\n\t<li><strong> Key facts and figures</strong></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>According to UNICEF, 22,000 children die each day due to poverty</li>\n\t<li>The poorest 40 percent of the world’s population accounts for 5 percent of global income.

The MDGs indicated that Member States should focus on donating 0.7% of their Gross National Income to developing countries. Whilst the MDGs focused on giving more to the developing countries, many scholars wonder if Europe should reduce its aid and instead, reinvest its time into discussing the ways of private investment, which not only provides jobs and security but also creates a long lasting future and help to achieve self-sustenance.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRecent research has questioned the advantages of giving aid freely and without direct purpose (with no gain for the Donor State), versus the benefits of private investment. In the study which followed, it was found that people become more readily involved in governance issues when money is being taxed rather than when aid is cut, therefore a case can be made, that in order to restructure governance and civic engagement, it is imperative to focus on government taxation and investment instead of merely distributing aid. <a href=\"#_ftn9\" name=\"_ftnref9\">[9]</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe UN Millennium Project Report noted the difficulties and negatives of the aid system, claiming it to be poorly targeted, frequently tied and highly unpredictable. While we understand that help is needed to increase sustainability in the growth of developing countries, how can we ensure economic, environmental and social sustainability in developing countries best? How can we reach a world where there is no poverty? At present in the EU we contribute more than half of the relief aid supplied to developing countries, with Member States and the EU supplying untied aid and private companies focusing on investment, which road leads us to a more sustainable future, where developing countries can become self-sufficient? Should there continue to be a mix of both donation and investment?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen just under double that of Official Development Aid (ODA) is contributed by private investors, how can the EU ensure that funding is reaching the areas it is most needed and what direction should the EU move in to ensure that the most efficient means of development are focused on?\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"7\">\n\t<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\nThe <strong>objectives of the European Year of development</strong> are defined as 1) informing EU citizens about the development cooperation of the EU and its member states, 2) fostering their active interest, critical thinking and direct involvement, and 3) raising awareness of the benefits of EU development cooperation. The motto chosen for the thematic year is \"Our world, our dignity, our future”. As 2015 is the Year for Development Cooperation in the EU,<strong> funding</strong> has been set aside for the likes of <strong>media campaigns and fora</strong> for individuals and Member States to come together to discuss and become proactive regarding Development\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe <strong>European Development Fund</strong>, created by the treaty of Rome, consists of contribution made by Member States, it runs in cycles of approximately 5 years and it places emphasis on certain parts of aid needed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe <strong>Cotonou Agreement<a href=\"#_ftn10\" name=\"_ftnref10\"><strong>[10]</strong></a></strong> offers a framework for the European Union’s (EU) cooperation relations for the economic, social and cultural development of the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP). The Cotonou Agreement places a strong emphasis on: the political dimension, development strategies and poverty reduction, economic development, most vulnerable states, economic and trade cooperation, regional cooperation and integration\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe United Nations summit for the adoption of the <strong>post-2015 development agenda</strong> will be held from 25 to 27 September 2015, in New York and convened as a high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Trading schemes</strong> - The EU has adjusted importing and exporting tariffs and taxes to allow for the growth and fairer involvement of developing countries on the market. The schemes prioritise least developed countries. <a href=\"#_ftn11\" name=\"_ftnref11\">[11]</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>The Commission ‘Communication</strong>’<a href=\"#_ftn12\" name=\"_ftnref12\">[12]</a> is a policy paper which proposes 12 concrete actions in order to, for instance, improve regulatory business environments in partner countries, support business development and increase access to finance with a focus on micro, small and medium-sized businesses in the formal and informal sector, which play a particularly vital role in job creation. The document identifies areas where to catalyse private sector finance and engagement to complement European Union development assistance.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNevin Mimica, the<strong> Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development</strong> outlined<strong> three aims</strong> as he spoke about the next steps in the relationship building between the EU and developing countries including; 1. An ambitious post-2015 framework 2. Launching and negotiating a post-Cotonou Framework 3.

Examples include:\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Thin capitalisation</strong>: A means of tax avoidance whereby a subsidiary of a company will loan money from another subsidiary in order to effectively transfer profits from a nation of high taxation to that of a lower one<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Transfer pricing</strong>: the setting of charges made between related parties for goods, services, or use of intellectual property. Such pricing between the divisions of an enterprise is supposed to be set at \"arm's length prices\"; the price at which it would be set between unrelated parties. In practice companies can illegally misprice these transfers in order to tax sales in places with lower excises<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\">[3]</a>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Immaterial rights</strong>: a form of transfer pricing often used by multi-national corporations for tax avoidance whereby they charge subsidiaries for the use of trademarks or other intellectual property<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\">[4]</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\t<li><strong>Tax Havens </strong>– Defined by; zero or nominal tax on the relevant income, lack of effective exchange of information, lack of transparency and no substantial economic activity<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\">[5]</a>\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Substantial economic activity</strong>, sometimes called ‘Genuine Business’ is disputed. Often characterized by the number of employees and the value of assets, it sometimes excludes companies that make and hold investments to combat tax avoidance.<a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\">[6]</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n\t<li><strong> Relevance and explanation of the issue</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\n<em>“The difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion is the thickness of a prison wall.” – <strong>Denis Healy, former British Chancellor of the Exchequer <a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\"><strong>[7]</strong></a></strong></em>\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nThe continued relevance of the former British chancellor’s quote highlights the importance of tax avoidance and evasion practices fifteen years on. It serves as a reminder of the everlasting nature of the problem as there will always be high incentives for rich individuals and companies to dodge taxes. With the law determining, sometimes vaguely, the legality of these practices the stakes of being caught on the wrong side of tax law remain high.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe magnitude of the<strong> capital losses</strong> for the EU from tax avoidance and evasion practices, which are estimated to be <strong>€1 trillion annually</strong><a href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\">[8]</a>, explains why this issue has been on top of the international agenda. Since <strong>national</strong> <strong>budgets</strong> heavily <strong>rely on taxes</strong>, this annual loss of revenue hinders Member States' ability to meet their <strong>economic and social responsibilities</strong>. This naturally affects citizens directly through different channels, including reduced policy financing and increased taxation.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDiscerning between tax avoidance and evasion is not always straightforward, and this is reinforced by the absence of a general tax code. For instance moving capital to offshore tax havens can be legal if the relevant tax authority is notified, or illegal otherwise. In essence, <strong>tax havens tend to attract capital inflows</strong> for different reasons including zero or very low tax rates, strict account secrecy, and political stability. At the corporation level, different mechanisms that corporations use in order to avoid taxation including <strong>thin capitalisation</strong>, <strong>transfer pricing</strong> and <strong>immaterial rights</strong>, make the distinction between legal and illegal practices even harder.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn addressing these issues, there are a number of relevant factors that should be taken into account; first and foremost <strong>distinguishing</strong> between <strong>legal</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>illegal</strong> <strong>tax practices</strong>, Member States' <strong>right to fiscal sovereignty</strong>, <strong>discrepancies in tax regulations</strong> among Member States, <strong>tax havens outside the EU</strong> that cannot be influenced by EU regulation, and the <strong>right</strong> <strong>of depositors</strong> <strong>to financial privacy</strong>.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"3\">\n\t<li><strong> Key questions</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>How important is the <strong>effect</strong> of <strong>tax avoidance</strong> and <strong>evasion</strong> practices?</li>\n\t<li>Is <strong>Aggressive Tax Planning</strong> by individuals and corporations <strong>illegal</strong>?</li>\n\t<li>What are the key <strong>mechanisms</strong> that <strong>corporations</strong> use to <strong>avoid taxes</strong>?

The aforementioned institutions following the Ordinary Procedure essentially provide a framework in which <strong>Member States </strong>and their respective<strong> National tax authorities </strong>tailor tax policy according to domestic needs.\u00a0 International efforts against tax avoidance and evasion are coordinated by international organisations, particularly the <strong>OECD</strong> and <strong>G20,</strong> making them additional key actors in this issue.\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n\t<li><strong> Key conflicts</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nOne of the most important conflicts as discussed above is the <strong>distinction between legal and illegal accounting practices</strong> to avoid taxation. This is particularly complex at the corporate level because of the different and often complex mechanisms used to avoid taxation, but it naturally remains the case at the individual level.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnother important conflict in this topic is the <strong>need for access to information by tax authorities</strong>, particularly when third-party states are involved, and the <strong>right of depositors to financial privacy</strong>. Lastly the <strong>right of Member States to fiscal sovereignty</strong> often conflicts with the <strong>need for coordinated action</strong> at the European Union level.\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n\t<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nThere have been efforts at both the <strong>European</strong> and the <strong>international level</strong> to combat tax avoidance and evasion. Focusing on the former, the EU essentially provides arrangements within which Member States have to coordinate policy according to domestic needs. The EU has developed a <strong>comprehensive toolbox</strong> to improve the ability of Member States <strong>to fight tax avoidance and tax evasion</strong>, including improved transparency, exchange of information, administrative cooperation, coordinated actions on aggressive tax planning and tax havens, and other country specific recommendations<a href=\"#_ftn10\" name=\"_ftnref10\">[10]</a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn particular, the <strong>EU Savings Tax Directive</strong> that is in force since 2005 lays down the principle of automatic exchange of information. Following its first review, the European Commission adopted an <strong>amending proposal</strong> in November 2008, aiming to close existing loopholes and better prevent tax evasion. This revised edition of the EU Savings Tax Directive was adopted by the Council of Ministers in March 2014.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe European Commission's <strong>Action Plan to further strengthen the fight against evasion and avoidance</strong> (December 2012) includes measures covering individuals, companies and uncooperative jurisdictions. It supports the development of the existing good governance policy, the wider issues of <strong>interaction with tax havens</strong> and of <strong>tackling aggressive tax planning</strong> and further aspects, including tax-related crimes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFurther measures include the <strong>Directive on mutual assistance for the recovery of taxes</strong>, which is in force since 2010, the <strong>VAT Reverse Charge Directive</strong> proposed by the Commission in 2009, the <strong>Regulation on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT</strong> which has been in force since 2012 and the <strong>Quick Reaction Mechanism</strong> <strong>to fight VAT fraud</strong> which was proposed by the Commission in July 2012.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nApart from the improvement of tax collection within each Member States and the increased cooperation across Member States as outlined above, the EU has taken steps towards a coherent policy vis-à-vis <strong>third countries</strong> in order to promote its <strong>standards of good governance in tax matters</strong>.\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n\t<li><strong> Links for further research</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n\n<em>Combating tax fraud and evasion</em>\n\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Fight against tax fraud and evasion; <strong>Taxation and Customs Union</strong>:</li>\n</ul>\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/taxation/tax_fraud_evasion/index_en.htm\n<ul>\n\t<li>Important overview;<strong> Combating tax fraud and evasion</strong>, Commission contribution to the European Council of 22 May 2013:\u00a0 http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/tax_en.pdf</li>\n\t<li>Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council; An <strong>Action Plan to strengthen the fight against tax fraud and tax evasion</strong>:</li>\n</ul>\nhttp://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52012DC0722&amp;from=EN\n<ul>\n\t<li>Commission Recommendation on <strong>Aggressive Tax Planning</strong>: http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/tax_fraud_evasion/c_2012_8806_en.pdf</li>\n\t<li>Council <strong>Directive on taxation of savings income</strong> in the form of interest payments:</li>\n</ul>\nhttp://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2001:0260:FIN:EN:PDF\n<ul>\n\t<li>Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament; <strong>Tax policy in the European Union priorities for the years ahead</strong><em>:</em></li>\n</ul>\nhttp://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2001:0260:FIN:EN:PDF\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Combating tax fraud and evasion; particularly in relation with third countries</em>\n\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on <strong>concrete ways to reinforce the fight against tax fraud and tax evasion including in relation to third countries</strong>: http://www.ipex.eu/IPEXL-WEB/dossier/document/COM20120351.do</li>\n\t<li>Commission Recommendation regarding <strong>measures intended to encourage third countries to apply minimum standards of good governance in tax matters</strong>: http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/tax_fraud_evasion/c_2012_8805_en.pdf</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>OECD resources on combating tax avoidance and evasion</em>\n\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n<ul>\n\t<li>OECD's Action Plan on <strong>Base Erosion and Profit Shifting</strong>: http://www.oecd.org/ctp/BEPSActionPlan.pdf</li>\n\t<li>Further <strong>BEPS</strong> Resources:</li>\n</ul>\nhttp://www.oecd.org/tax/beps-reports.htm\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>OECD Model Tax Convention</strong> on Income and on Capital:</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/tax/treaties/oecd-model-tax-convention-available-products.htm\">http://www.oecd.org/tax/treaties/oecd-model-tax-convention-available-products.htm</a>\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\"><em><strong>[1]</strong></em></a><em><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/tax_fraud_evasion/c_2012_8806_en.pdf\">\"Commission Recommendation on Aggressive Tax Planning\", C(2012) 8806 final, European Commission, 2012</a> </em>\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\"><em><strong>[2]</strong></em></a><em> <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/ctp/tax-global/5.%20Thin_Capitalization_Background.pdf\">Thin Capitalisation Legislation; A Background Paper For Country Tax Administrations – OECD 2012</a></em>\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref3\" name=\"_ftn3\"><em><strong>[3]</strong></em></a><em> <a href=\"http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/tax/publications/transfer-pricing/perspectives/assets/tpp-progressbutnoguarantees.pdf\">Transfer Pricing Perspectives - PWC</a></em>\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref4\" name=\"_ftn4\"><em><strong>[4]</strong></em></a><em> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20580545\">Corporate tax avoidance: How do companies do it?

To increase the speed and stability of the plane, it would be good to add a second engine: capital market financing.” –</em> <strong><em>Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank</em></strong>\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nSMEs are often described as the ‘backbone’ or ‘lifeblood’ of European economy. As a matter of fact, the soundness of our economies largely rests upon them: SMEs create jobs, support economic growth and are an immense reservoir of innovative capacity. However, like any large business, an SME cannot function without money. 80% of European SMEs’ funds come from the banking system, compared to only 50% in the United States.<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a> The dependence of European SMEs on bank loans has become problematic since the beginning of the economic and financial crisis. Banks are reluctant to invest and consequentially SMEs applying for bank loans face more rejections, receive less than desired, or have to pay substantial interest rates.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSubsequently, the EU and its Member States have taken measures and designed mechanisms to make it easier for SMEs to get bank loans by offering guarantees and minimising risks for banks. There is now a need to equip SMEs with tools to diversify their sources of funding and in particular to secure funding on capital markets. Yet problems remain. High risks and the difficulty of assessing especially SMEs’ risks deter potential investors, while the cost of raising funds and lack of knowledge prevent entrepreneurs from entering capital markets.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"3\">\n\t<li><strong> Key questions</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>What are the advantages and disadvantages of public (e.g. EU funding programmes) and market-based (e.g. private equity) funding strategies?</li>\n\t<li>How are SMEs of different sizes, locations and sectors affected by funding issues? What branches are already taken care of?</li>\n\t<li>Which financing strategies are the most sustainable and applicable to a large proportion of European SMEs?</li>\n\t<li>Do SMEs of different sizes, at different development stages, based in different countries and operating in different sectors, have the same financing needs. Can they access the same sources?<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\">[3]</a></li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n\t<li><strong> Key facts and figures</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>99% of European firms are SMEs, accounting for 21.6 million enterprises in 2014. That same year European SMEs employed 88.8 million people, which represent 2 out of 3 jobs in the private sector, and contributed to 58% (€3,666 trillion) of the value added created in the EU.<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\">[4]</a> 91% of European enterprises are micro-enterprises.<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\">[5]</a></li>\n\t<li>SMEs go through four development stages: seed, start-up, early growth and sustained growth, which influence their financing needs.</li>\n\t<li>15% of European SMEs say that their main concern is raising funds.<a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\">[6]</a></li>\n\t<li>62% of European SMEs prefer bank loans to finance their activities; 7% only prefer equity investment. Bank loans are most used in Belgium, France (73%) and Portugal (71%), while equity is most popular in Sweden (27%), Croatia (23%) and Greece (21%).<a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\">[7]</a> However these preferences are homogenous across sectors, sizes and innovativeness, with 59 to 67% of SMEs preferring bank loans and 5 to 9% preferring equity.<a href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\">[8]</a></li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n\t<li><strong> Key actors</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nMostly concerned by the issue are of course <strong>SMEs</strong> that have to decide on their financing strategies. <strong>Individuals</strong> are key in SME financing, firstly because over 90% of European SMEs have less than 10 employees and are run by a small number of people, and secondly because SMEs can raise funds from individual investors such as business angels, or by mobilising their personal networks for crowdfunding.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPublic institutions both at national and EU level can nudge SMEs in the direction of capital markets. The EU institutions, among which mostly the <strong>European Commission</strong> (EC) and its Directorate-General (DG) for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, design EU funding programmes and the priorities of their investment. The Commission also designates the EU SME envoy, whose task it is to promote SMEs’ interests in the Commission’s work. The European Investment Fund (<strong>EIF</strong>) has the specific task of helping European SMEs access finance. <strong>National governments</strong> take measures to support SMEs in their respective territories and might be in a better position to act on the national capital markets\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nAt the EU level, the interests of 12 million SMEs employing 55 million people are represented by the <strong>European Association of Craft, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises</strong> (UEAPME). Finally, stakeholders are gathered in associations such as the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), the European Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (EVCA), the European Trade Association for Business Angels (EBAN), Seed Funds and Early Stage Market Players, Business Angels Europe (BAE), the European Crowdfunding Network (ECN), and the European Business and Innovation Centre Network (EBN).\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n\t<li><strong> Key conflicts</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nThe first issue to contemplate is the <strong>type of measure</strong>. A country can decide to offer <strong>public incentives</strong> to develop equity finance: for instance the UK has a Venture Capital Trust Scheme which is based on tax reductions for individuals who invest in high-risk SMEs; Germany has the ERP Startup Fund, which operates on the basis of co-investment with the private sector in young technology-based firms; France has two investment funds that aim to facilitate equity. On the other hand, <strong>private operators</strong> can also trigger change in financing habits: the AIM is a stock exchange for small companies in the UK; NYSE Alternext in France is designed to attract SMEs and allow them to go public. The efficiency and sustainability of both types of measures need to be studied.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA different debate could focus on the <strong>targets of the measures</strong>. Action can be taken either on SMEs or on the markets. If one chooses to <strong>target SMEs</strong>, consideration should be given to improving the transparency of their business strategies and their creditworthiness,<a href=\"#_ftn9\" name=\"_ftnref9\">[9]</a> in order to provide investors with more information about the kind of risks they are taking. Contrary to large firms, SMEs’ business strategies, organisational structure or the contracts they sign, are rarely made public, or SMEs might have an interest in keeping their strategy private in their early stages of development.<a href=\"#_ftn10\" name=\"_ftnref10\">[10]</a> As for the <strong>markets</strong>, several things need be addressed. One could reduce legal, accounting and marketing costs for SMEs; develop alternative capital markets specifically tailored to SMEs’ needs<a href=\"#_ftn11\" name=\"_ftnref11\">[11]</a>. Other options include striving for more general and lasting measures aiming to create an SME-friendly ecosystem and to provide more flexibility and options, for example through funding escalators that offer adapted types of finance depending on the SME’s development stage.<a href=\"#_ftn12\" name=\"_ftnref12\">[12]</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"7\">\n\t<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nAt the EU level, a large number of measures target SMEs and SME funding. First of all, the EU passed a <strong>Small Business Act for Europe</strong> in 2008, aiming to create an SME-friendly environment based on a ‘Think Small First’ principle and to ‘<em>tackle the remaining problems which hamper their development.</em>’<a href=\"#_ftn13\" name=\"_ftnref13\">[13]</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn this spirit, the EU has increasingly taken measures specifically targeting SMEs. These targeted measures are coordinated by the Executive Agency for SMEs (EASME). The main part of these measures are the financial instruments of <strong>COSME</strong><a href=\"#_ftn14\" name=\"_ftnref14\">[14]</a>. The COSME pillar for better access to finance for SMEs establishes an Equity Facility for Growth (EFG)<a href=\"#_ftn15\" name=\"_ftnref15\">[15]</a> supporting venture capital and mezzanine finance solutions for SMEs. EASME also manages SME instruments in the field of research and innovation: the funding programme ‘Horizon 2020’ offers an instrument for <strong>access to risk finance</strong> for highly innovative firms that supports equity finance in the early stages of an SME’s life.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBesides help for accessing new finance instruments, the EU provides SMEs with <strong>information and support services</strong>. It has set up the locally-based Enterprise Europe Network (EEN) to help SMEs identify and reach investors, venture capitals and public funds. The business portal ‘Your Europe’ centralises information on a wide range of topics, from customs to funding and environmental issues, while the European Small Business Portal is conceived specifically for SMEs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSMEs are also included in larger EU programmes, such as the recent Investment Plan for Europe and the upcoming Capital Markets Union. \u00a0The <strong>Investment Plan for Europe</strong>, launched in November 2014 by the EC and the European Investment Bank (EIB), aims at mobilising €315 billion over the next 3 years, including €75bn that should go to SMEs and mid-cap companies (up to 3000 employees). However, the plan has yet to prove successful since it rests on the EU’s ability to mobilise private investors.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nInitially suggested in October 2014, Jean-Claude Juncker, the Commission president, has put the idea of a <strong>Capital Markets Union</strong> (CMU) back on the table to support the Investment Plan. The Commission announced in January 2015 that it would start making plans to set up the CMU. The idea behind it is to remove barriers between national capital markets in the EU, which would, in effect, make the European system more similar to the United States, where funding is widely provided by the markets. The CMU should make it easier for investors to go international and access data, less costly for firms to seek funds on capital markets, and offer more choice and opportunities for all stakeholders.<a href=\"#_ftn16\" name=\"_ftnref16\">[16]</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFinally, the EU <strong>monitors SMEs’ access to finance</strong> through the SME access to finance (SMAF) index which maps developments and differences across countries in access to debt and equity finance. The Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB) lead an annual survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE). The EU also communicates with SMEs about best practices and available financial instruments by organising meetings (‘EU Access to Finance Days’) in all member states.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe <strong>European Investment Fund</strong> has a particular role within the EU to support SME finance. The EIF has set up a large variety of tools to support equity, such as the European Angels Fund (EAF), the Social Impact Accelerator (SIA) for social enterprises, and the Mezzanine Facility for Growth. Finally, the EIF is present at the local level through a series of regional and sectorial initiatives, which you can check <a href=\"http://www.eif.org/what_we_do/resources/funds_of_funds/index.htm\">here</a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMeasures taken by <strong>national governments</strong> vary from country to country. The general trend goes towards bank-oriented solutions, while less than half of the EU member states have offered solutions to promote venture capital, equity funding or business angel support.<a href=\"#_ftn17\" name=\"_ftnref17\">[17]</a> Public support for equity can be either direct (e.g. investment in venture capital funds) or indirect (e.g. tax incentives): the UK grants a tax relief up to £100,000 to individuals who invest in early-stage SMEs for at least 3 years, while France has set up a strategic investment fund that invests in venture capital funds which themselves invest in SMEs.<a href=\"#_ftn18\" name=\"_ftnref18\">[18]</a> The European Commission has published <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/finance/guide-to-funding/indirect-funding/index_en.htm#h2-2\">country factsheets</a> giving an overview of the measures implemented in each EU member state.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"8\">\n\t<li><strong> Links for further research</strong></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Facts and figures: SMEs in the EU</em>\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>European Commission (2014): “Annual Report on European SMEs.

But we cannot afford to be complacent.” –<strong>Michael Cashman, MEP</strong></em>\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nReproductive rights are a subset of human rights that deal with areas of sexual health, family planning and reproductive freedom. Though their importance was first highlighted at the International Conference on Human Rights in Tehran in 1968, there is still significant lack of consensus both about what these rights entail, and how they should be guaranteed. The most widely agreed upon interpretation comes from the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), which published a programme of action<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\"><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a> in 1994 referring to the\n\n&nbsp;\n\n“right of men and women to be informed and to have access\n\nto safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of family\n\nplanning of their choice, as well as other methods of their choice\n\nfor regulation of fertility which are not against the law, and the\n\nright of access to appropriate health-care services that will enable\n\nwomen to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth and provide\n\ncouples with the best chance of having a healthy infant”.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlthough this obviously was intended as neither an exhaustive list nor a complete definition, it does provide a sufficient basis for countries to attempt to guarantee the reproductive rights of their citizens. Despite this, few, and perhaps even no, countries discharge this burden completely.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSome countries have been identified as being particularly weak. A UN report<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\"><sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></a> from late 2014 pointed to specific failings in Romania, including a maternal mortality rate of twice the EU average and the highest number of live births among girls under fifteen. An unacceptably high rate of unregulated abortion is still present in many Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries, though this has decreased in recent years. Contraceptive usage in the CEE countries is similarly disappointing, with a 2012 report<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\"><sup><sup>[5]</sup></sup></a> highlighting the many causes, including among others, a lack of commitment to reproductive health, limited forms of contraception and information about how to use or choose between them and prohibitively high costs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nUnfortunately, the depth and scale of the problem is difficult to quantify, as complete statistics exist in no state. Some countries suffer from an inability to collect full data, some choose not to measure a variety of indicators, some factors are difficult to measure and ultimately, because reproductive and sexual health covers such a variety of elements, measurement and comparison are not easy. One of the more difficult factors to quantify is sexual education. In European countries with significant Catholic populations like Ireland and Poland, “sex ed” often involves curricula far behind their more secular neighbours<a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\"><sup><sup>[6]</sup></sup></a>, while in areas of the United Kingdom, Italy and some other countries sex education is not compulsory. National attitudes also play a role with discussion of sexual health still a taboo subject in certain countries. Often, sex education curricula are written intended to reduce the incidence of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and some other Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), and do not contain enough information about other aspects of sexual health.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut reproductive rights pertain to safeguarding all aspects of the sexual health of women and men, and are not limited to guaranteeing that those who do not intend to become pregnant do not do so. There is an increasing movement of people demanding greater levels of control over what they believe to constitute “responsible reproduction”<a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\"><sup><sup>[7]</sup></sup></a>, including screening for genetic illnesses. The United Kingdom recently became the first country to legalise the use of mitochondrial donation, whereby in-vitro fertilisation allows healthy mitochondria from a donor to replace the damaged mitochondria of the mother, thus avoiding a number of complex and serious diseases.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGenetic screening of embryos is legal in Europe in cases where the transmission of genetic disease is likely, though embryo selection for non-medical reasons is strictly prohibited. This is likely to be an issue only in countries that have already achieved a certain level of basic reproductive rights, which many still struggle to reach.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nUnfortunately, many people conflate the terms “reproductive rights” and the right to legal abortion. These two things are not the same, though some countries may choose to provide access to abortion as one of the reproductive rights it guarantees. This misleading fallacy has distracted from the debate in many countries, and retarded proper legislation on abortion, and on other elements of sexual health.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe combination of these factors and problems leads to a highly complex situation for European lawmakers and NGOs. No single strategy will address the problems specific to each country, and any standardised targets must recognise the different baselines from which each country begins. Lawmakers and citizens in some countries will also find certain elements of any proposed strategy unpalatable, but the priority must lie with safeguarding the health of European men and women.\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n\t<li><strong> Key questions</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Why is there such a disparity in access to reproductive rights across the European continent?</li>\n\t<li>How can a comprehensive programme tackle basic issues such as maternal mortality and morbidity in Eastern European countries, as well as more advanced ones like access to cutting edge genetic medicine?</li>\n\t<li>How can the discourse surrounding reproductive rights avoid the over-politicisation that has so far hampered fruitful policy making? Is the legalisation of abortion central to this discourse, or incidental to it?</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>What is the role of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in the advancement of reproductive rights and sexual health? How is this best balanced with the role of national governments?</li>\n\t<li>To what extent should national governments provide free or subsidised access to family planning and sexual health services and resources?</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n\t<li><strong> Key facts and figures</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Goal 5 of the Millennium Development Goals is the improvement of maternal health. Its targets include a reduction of three-quarters (from the 1990 rate) in the maternal mortality ratio by 2015, and universal access to reproductive health in 2015.</li>\n\t<li>Maternal mortality is the indicator most widely used to assess changes in maternal health. However, mortality does not, by definition, take into account changes in morbidity or quality of life. In many countries these data are not collected, and in some others they are not made available to NGOs wishing to assess progress. Maternal mortality figures for most countries globally are available here.</li>\n\t<li>The UK has one of the highest teenage birth and abortion rates in Western Europe, despite having the second highest use of contraception, Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia and Estonia all have similarly high rates.</li>\n\t<li>Latvia (at 34 per 100,000), Romania (at 27), Hungary (at 21) and Luxembourg (at 20) have maternal mortality rates far exceeding their other European neighbours, where the lower rates are between 2 and 10 per 100,000.</li>\n\t<li>Finland has a mandatory sexual education curriculum that is one of the most comprehensive worldwide, and makes emergency contraception available without prescription. This has lead to low and decreasing rates of unplanned adolescent pregnancy. However, Finland does not provide free contraception for all, nor do many other European Union Member States.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n\t<li><strong> Key actors</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nMember States are the main source of legislation on reproductive rights. It is within the competence of each Member State to determine the content of its curricula, the medical practices it allows and subsidises, and the legality of any forms of contraception, including abortion. It is also on a national level that opinions are formed or challenged, meaning that the attitude of the citizenry has a large influence on the laws of that country, but also vice versa because of the normative effect of law. This also limits the influence other actors, including NGOs, can have on countries, especially on a legal level.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe UN Population Fund describes itself as the “lead UN agency for delivering a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every birth safe and every young person’s potential fulfilled”.\u00a0 The UNFPA has concentrated much of its work in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and determines that though improvements have been made since (date of prior WHO survey) these countries are still far away from having even acceptable levels of reproductive rights. The UNFPA is the main data-collecting organisation in the region, as well as the main source of assessment and statistics on the issue.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe Centre for Reproductive Rights (CRR) is a global organisation that advocates for the right to abortion. It has helped numerous women take cases to the European Court of Human Rights in past years, and was one of the first groups to frame preventable maternal death as a human rights violation. The CRR believes that abortion is a fundamental reproductive right, and as such many of its campaigns are focused on forcing countries that outlaw it to legalise the practice, and obliging countries with restrictions to loosen them.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nASTRA is a network of activist organisations, operating mainly in Central and Eastern Europe. It aims to promote women's sexual and reproductive health and rights in the region and to ensure a prominent place for these issues on national and regional agendas. It collaborates with other European NGOs often as part of a network including European NGOs for Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights, Population and Development (EuroNGOs), Countdown 2015 Europe, the International Planned Parenthood Federation, European Network (IPPF EN).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEUROSTAT is the European Statistics Agency, which exists as a Directorate General and provides statistics to other EU bodies. REPROSTAT is a project coordinated by EUROSTAT to investigate indicators of reproductive health in the EU.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has so far played a defining role in shaping the conversation about reproductive rights. Though the work of the WHO is predominantly in developing countries, it also works to “develop norms, tools and guidelines on reproductive health in general and abortion services in particular, and supports countries in reforming their health systems” over the world, including in Europe.\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n\t<li><strong> Key conflicts</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nDisputes over the content of sexual education classes are widespread in several European countries. The objections are often on religious grounds, either from advocacy groups that lobby for the omission of certain subjects, or from parents who maintain that their right to practise religion, and raise their children within the auspices of that faith should be grounds enough to withdraw their child from any class that may be inconsistent. The balance between guaranteeing the future safety of these children and those around them with their freedom to practice religion requires the treading of a fine line, and cannot be resolved without sensitivity.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe introduction of the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine, intended to combat the incidence of cervical cancer also provoked backlash in a number of countries. Much of this was from conservative elements of the population who objected to the need to determine and codify the age of sexual maturity in adolescent girls as a step that would become normative.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMany groups who advocate for reproductive rights include abortion among the resources they would like to see. In countries where there is significant opposition to abortion only this reduces the political capital of these organisations and politicians and decreases their ability to achieve other incremental changes to policy. Organisations like the CRR, an American NGO, have created substantial backlash, and for countries who oppose the legalisation of abortion like Ireland, this has created entrenchment and significantly hampered fruitful discourse.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe debate over genetic screening revolves around the fear that parents and doctors will choose to “play God” with the power they would wield. Currently, genetic screening is allowed only in the case where parents fear they may pass on hereditary disease, but in vitro tests could also be performed to determine, and therefore choose an embryo based on gender, or certain physical or genetic traits. Significant opposition exists from conservatives about <em>any</em> kind of genetic testing or interference, as was recently evident in the criticism of the UK’s move to legalise mitochondrial donation.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"7\">\n\t<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nSeveral European countries have instituted a vaccination programme, providing inoculations against HPV, a sexually transmitted infection that increases susceptibility to cervical cancer. <a href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\"><sup><sup>[8]</sup></sup></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe Millennium Development Goals (in particular Goal 5) were intended more as a global goal, and as such work toward the targets has mainly focused on Africa and East Asia. Maternal mortality in the period 1990 to 2015 has actually increased in some European countries<a href=\"#_ftn9\" name=\"_ftnref9\"><sup><sup>[9]</sup></sup></a>, and the success of increasing access to reproductive health has been mixed, though data are scarce.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSeveral investigations into increasing the quality of sexual education in schools have been carried out by the European Parliament<a href=\"#_ftn10\" name=\"_ftnref10\"><sup><sup>[10]</sup></sup></a>, which determined that while quality was mixed, programmes were “improving”. The report juxtaposed the current state of the curricula against a time when these classes were almost all voluntary and infrequent, and so this qualification is very much relative, and is not an especially positive review in absolute terms.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBetween 2003 and 2006 the European Commission maintained a funding instrument<a href=\"#_ftn11\" name=\"_ftnref11\"><sup><sup>[11]</sup></sup></a> through which aimed to increase access to and quality of reproductive rights in Member States. This instrument provided funds to national and local governments and NGOs for research and the provision of services. This was to be augmented by an EP resolution in 2013<a href=\"#_ftn12\" name=\"_ftnref12\"><sup><sup>[12]</sup></sup></a> that stressed that a “strong EU position” on RR would require “a strong push” from the EP, but ultimately failed to provide such strength.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe European Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights Community released a position paper<a href=\"#_ftn13\" name=\"_ftnref13\"><sup><sup>[13]</sup></sup></a> on the post 2015 agenda with five goals: gender equality, women’s empowerment and women’s rights; the formalisation of a goal with specific health targets; the addressing of population dynamics as a human rights issue; a formal educational goal and a focus on European youth.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"8\">\n\t<li><strong> Links for further research</strong></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Current European Measures and Reports</em>\n\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n<ul>\n\t<li>A comparative outline of measures available in various EU countries, published by the Family Federation of Finland:</li>\n</ul>\nhttp://vaestoliitto-fi-bin.directo.fi/@Bin/c949699fc18a04145d958cbe26d853fc/1423671336/application/pdf/1740298/EU%20Country%20Positions%20on%20Sexual%20and%20Reproductive%20Rights%20Issues.pdf\n<ul>\n\t<li>The Sexual and Reproductive Rights Hub of the European Parliamentary Research Service: <a href=\"http://epthinktank.eu/2013/01/19/sexual-and-reproductive-health-and-rights/\">http://epthinktank.eu/2013/01/19/sexual-and-reproductive-health-and-rights/</a></li>\n\t<li>Europa (the official EU website) Population Homepage on reproductive health: <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/health/population_groups/gender/reproductive/index_en.htm#fragment0\">http://ec.europa.eu/health/population_groups/gender/reproductive/index_en.htm#fragment0</a></li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>External Sources: including NGOs and related references</em>\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>Amnesty International summary of SRR in Europe:</li>\n</ul>\nhttp://www.amnestyusa.org/pdfs/SexualReproductiveRightsFactSheet.pdf\n<ul>\n\t<li>Factsheet on current cases making their way through the ECHR:</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_Reproductive_ENG.pdf\">http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_Reproductive_ENG.pdf</a>\n<ul>\n\t<li>2015 Report from the UNFPA on Maternal Health in the CEE Countries:</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/maternal_health.pdf\">http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/maternal_health.pdf</a>\n<ul>\n\t<li>UNFPA Report on Contraceptive Use in the CEE Countries:</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://eeca.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/Rep_Keyfactorsinflcontractusein7ctries_Dec2012.pdf\">http://eeca.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/Rep_Keyfactorsinflcontractusein7ctries_Dec2012.pdf</a>\n<ul>\n\t<li>2014 ASTRA Report on SRHRs in the CEE Countries:</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://www.astra.org.pl/pdf/publications/ASTRA_Factsheet_2014.pdf\">http://www.astra.org.pl/pdf/publications/ASTRA_Factsheet_2014.pdf</a>\n\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n\n<em>Most recent work from the European Parliament on Reproductive Rights</em>\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>European Parliament (FEMM) Motion for a Resolution on Reproductive Rights: <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+REPORT+A7-2013-0426+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN\">http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+REPORT+A7-2013-0426+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN</a></li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>An article describing the failure of this Motion for a Resolution to pass at plenary level: https://euobserver.com/social/122418</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\"><em><sup><strong><sup>[1]</sup></strong></sup></em></a> <em><a href=\"http://www.who.int/topics/family_planning/en/\">http://www.who.int/topics/family_planning/en/</a></em>\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\"><em><sup><strong><sup>[2]</sup></strong></sup></em></a> <em><a href=\"http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/sexual_health/sh_definitions/en/\">http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/sexual_health/sh_definitions/en/</a></em>\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref3\" name=\"_ftn3\"><em><sup><strong><sup>[3]</sup></strong></sup></em></a><em>Programme of Action from ICPD 1994, Cairo.

But I will not sacrifice Europe's safety, health, social and data protection standards, or our cultural diversity, on the altar of free trade.\" <a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\"><strong>[6]</strong></a>– <strong>Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission</strong></em>\n\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n\nThe transatlantic economic and trade relationship is the backbone of the world economy. Together, the EU and the United States of America (US) account for nearly half of the world’s GDP (47%), and one-third of global trade. Every day, goods and services worth €2 billion are traded between both parties and about 15 million jobs depend on the strong ties between the EU and US economies.<a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\">[7]</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn times when the EU’s economic growth is staggering and the unemployment rates in especially the southern Member States reach new peaks, the free trade agreement between the EU and the US seems like a suitable additional pulse for the European economic engine. According to a study by the European Commission<a href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\"><sup><sup>[8]</sup></sup></a> (EC), the size of the EU´s economy is expected to grow by 0.5% of GDP after the ratification of the agreement. Among others, that means that the EU’s export sector could increase by several millions of jobs and that wages for both skilled and less skilled workers might grow by 0.5%. At the same time, the lowering of production costs and the costs for exports between the two markets could lead to cheaper products for the consumers. The study estimates that the average European household of four will see its disposable income increase by about €500 per year, as a result of the combined effect of wage increases and price reductions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDuring the EU-US Summit in November 2011, leaders of the European Union and the United States tasked the <strong>Transatlantic Economic Council</strong><a href=\"#_ftn9\" name=\"_ftnref9\">[9]</a><strong> (TEC) </strong>to establish a High Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth chaired by the US Trade Representative and the EU Trade Commissioner. The Working Group was requested to identify measures to increase EU-US trade and investment. In February 2013, the recommendation of the High Level Working Group to launch negotiations on a comprehensive economic and free trade agreement was endorsed by the EC. These negotiations began in July 2013.\n\nIn February 2015, the 8<sup>th</sup> round of negotiations between the EU, led by EU Chief Negotiator Ignacio Garcia Bercero and his counterpart <strong>United States Trade Representative</strong><a href=\"#_ftn10\" name=\"_ftnref10\">[10]</a><strong> (USTR) </strong>Ambassador Michael Froman took place in Brussels. Nearly all areas of the TTIP have been discussed except for the Investor-State-Dispute-Settlement (ISDS). It has been publicly announced that both parties agree that regulators from both sides need to be included in the negotiations and that the EU’s standards of consumer, health and environment protection cannot be downgraded. A consensus on the food safety, and animal and plant health matters seems to have been achieved. Thus, both the US and the EU have expressed their belief in environmental protection. A common ground and the consolidation in these areas shall be finalised during the next discussion rounds.

At the end of the 8<sup>th</sup> round of negotiations in Brussels, EU Chief Negotiator Ignacio Garcia Bercero already announced that two more negotiation meetings have been scheduled before the summer break<a href=\"#_ftn25\" name=\"_ftnref25\">[25]</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n\t<li><strong> Key actors</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nIn 2013, the governments of the EU Member States gave the <strong>European Commission </strong>a mandate to negotiate the TTIP from June 2013 onwards. At the end of the negotiations, the negotiated texts will be given to the Council and the European Parliament for a unanimous double democratic guarantee. The newly elected President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker lists the conclusion of the negotiations as one his priorities<a href=\"#_ftn26\" name=\"_ftnref26\">[26]</a>. The <strong>Directorate-General (DG) for Trade </strong>and<strong> EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström</strong> are mandated with the negotiations with regards to the bilateral Free Trade Agreement with the US that respects EU citizens’ safety, health, social and data protection and cultural diversity<a href=\"#_ftn27\" name=\"_ftnref27\">[27]</a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFurther, the <strong>DG for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs</strong> and <strong>EU Commissioner Elżbieta Bieńkowska<a href=\"#_ftn28\" name=\"_ftnref28\"><strong>[28]</strong></a> </strong>actively participate in the negotiations for a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. The DG for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs ensures, among others, an open internal market for goods and services in the EU and improves the range, quality, and competitiveness of products and services on the internal market. Thus, the DG for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs\u00a0is involved on a day-to-day basis in the TTIP negotiations, which are undertaken under DG Trade's coordination. The negotiations include three equally important pillars: market access, NTBs, and rules to address global challenges<a href=\"#_ftn29\" name=\"_ftnref29\">[29]</a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe<strong> USTR </strong>is the negotiating body for the TTIP matters from the US side. Thus, the<strong> TEC </strong>is the body that directs the economic cooperation between the US and the EU. The Council is tasked with regulation harmonisation and deepen the cooperation between the governments in economic issues.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"6\">\n\t<li><strong> Key conflicts</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nWhile many discussion points are currently being negotiated between the US and the EU, the fundamental challenge lies in the fact that, for the first time in history, the two biggest economies worldwide are trying to create one common free trade economic area. To successfully cut red tape, both parties need to find an understanding of how to balance the clear benefits of the TTIP whilst hearing the concerns of the numerous activists’ groups<a href=\"#_ftn30\" name=\"_ftnref30\">[30]</a> with regards to the ISDS and the reduction of environmental, public services, and consumer standards<a href=\"#_ftn31\" name=\"_ftnref31\">[31]</a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe ISDS chapter seems to be the source of the biggest concerns towards the TTIP by both, political opponents and activists’ groups. Surprisingly, this very chapter was the only one left out of the discussions during the 8<sup>th</sup> round of negotiations and is planned to be discussed in the final phase of the negotiations only<a href=\"#_ftn32\" name=\"_ftnref32\">[32]</a>. There is a strong suspicion that US companies, with their litigious approach, will use ISDS as a means of putting the frighteners on elected governments.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe US Dodd-Frank Act signed in 2010<a href=\"#_ftn33\" name=\"_ftnref33\">[33]</a> as a response to the devastating causes of the financial crisis of 2008 has enhanced the regulations of the formerly loose US financial sector very heavily. The US argues that Dodd-Frank is moving at a faster pace than its EU equivalent, the EC Capital Requirements Directive IV<a href=\"#_ftn34\" name=\"_ftnref34\">[34]</a>. While the Dodd-Frank Act has enhanced financial regulation in the US, the EU has moved toward a banking union and increased regulatory oversight<a href=\"#_ftn35\" name=\"_ftnref35\">[35]</a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThough either approach is not necessarily excluding the other, the EU and the US must find a common way forward by either choosing to mutually recognise each others’ standards, go ahead with one set of rules or develop a harmonised set of rules.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"7\">\n\t<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nIn general, tariffs between the EU and the US are already relatively low given the size of the trading bloc (under 3%)<a href=\"#_ftn36\" name=\"_ftnref36\">[36]</a>, however they are not entirely eliminated. Whilst there is no agreement like the TTIP in terms of scale there are many other FTAs that have paved the way for these talks as free trade has been on the global agenda for many decades with the trend being undisputedly towards lowering tariffs and barriers. However few attempts have been made at NTBs before<a href=\"#_ftn37\" name=\"_ftnref37\">[37]</a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe EU aims at keeping its strict legislation regarding food safety, and animal and plant health. The EU is aiming at keeping its restrictions on hormones or growth promoters in livestock farming. Thus, growing genetically modified organisms (GMOs) will prospectively be subject to an authorisation process in line with EU law<a href=\"#_ftn38\" name=\"_ftnref38\">[38]</a>. Within EU legislation, GMOs are subject to extensive, case-by-case, science-based food evaluation by the European Food Safety Authority<a href=\"#_ftn39\" name=\"_ftnref39\">[39]</a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn January 2012, the EC has proposed a comprehensive reform of the EU's 1995 data protection rules to strengthen online privacy rights and boost Europe's digital economy<a href=\"#_ftn40\" name=\"_ftnref40\">[40]</a>. The proposed new EU data protection regime extends the scope of EU data protection law to all foreign companies processing data of EU residents. It provides a harmonisation of the data protection regulations throughout the EU, thereby making it easier for US companies to comply with these regulations; however, this comes at the cost of a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to 2% of worldwide<a href=\"#_ftn41\" name=\"_ftnref41\">[41]</a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe ratification of the agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights<a href=\"#_ftn42\" name=\"_ftnref42\">[42]</a> (TRIPs) is a compulsory requirement of World Trade Organisation (WTO) membership and the access to numerous international markets opened by the WTO coming with it. The TRIPs agreement covers a wide range of IP areas ranging from copyright to trademarks. Both, EU Member States and the US are members of the WTO and thereby comply with the TRIPs agreement.\n\nInvestment is a vital part of any economy and investors need to be sure that they will be treated fairly when investing abroad. That is why the EU wants to prevent ISDS abuse and conflicts of interest in arbitrators by introducing a code of conduct. Thus, introducing safeguards preventing tribunals from ordering the repeal of governmental measures are meant to allow Member States to maintain control over the interpretation of investment provision<a href=\"#_ftn43\" name=\"_ftnref43\">[43]</a>.\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n\t<li><strong> Links for further research</strong></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Introduction into the TTIP</em>\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>The Directorate-General for Trade of the European Commission (2015): “About TTIP”:</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/about-ttip/\">http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/about-ttip/</a>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Herbert A.

It consists of generating stations that produce electrical power, high-voltage transmission lines that carry power from distant sources to demand centers, and distribution lines that connect individual customers<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>renewable energy sources (RES) – </strong>Renewable energy is energy that is derived from natural processes (e.g. sunlight and wind) that are replenished at a higher rate than they are consumed. Solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, bioenergy and ocean power are sources of renewable energy. The role of renewables continues to increase in the electricity, heating and cooling and transport sectors<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>energy mix - </strong>The term energy mix refers to how final energy consumption in a given geographical region breaks down by primary energy source. It includes fossil fuels (oil, natural gas and coal), nuclear energy, waste and the many types of renewable energy (biomass, wind, geothermal, water and solar). These primary energy sources are used to generate electricity, provide fuel for transportation, and heat and cool residential and industrial buildings<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\">[3]</a>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions – </strong>Around 10% of the GHG emitted worldwide in 2012 came from the EU. With measures taken at European level and by Member States at national level, the EU is well on track towards meeting its targets for cutting GHG emissions both under its own internal target in the Europe 2020 Strategy and under the Kyoto Protocol's second commitment period (2013-2020)<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\">[4]</a>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>network codes – </strong>Network codes are sets of rules which apply to one or more parts of the energy sector. The need for them was identified during the course of developing the Third Energy Package<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\">[5]</a>. More specifically, Regulation (EC) 714/2009 sets out the areas in which network codes will be developed and a process for developing them<a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\">[6]</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n\t<li><strong> Relevance and explanation of the issue</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\n<em>“I want to reform and reorganise Europe’s energy policy in a new European Energy Union.” – <strong>Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission<a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\"><strong>[7]</strong></a></strong></em>\n\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n\nLast April, Donald Tusk, then prime minister of Poland and current president of the European Council, launched the idea of a European ‘energy union’ with an article published in the Financial Times<a href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\">[8]</a>. The new European Commission (EC), led by Jean-Claude Juncker, has made creating a European energy union its priority<a href=\"#_ftn9\" name=\"_ftnref9\">[9]</a> and is expected to publish an official strategy on 25 February<a href=\"#_ftn10\" name=\"_ftnref10\">[10]</a>. What does a union on energy mean and does it mean the same to everyone?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Background</span>\n\nThe EU has based its energy policy on the 2006 EC green paper “<em>A European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy”</em>. The strategy introduced three fully balanced, integrated and mutually reinforced pillars; <strong>competitiveness</strong>, <strong>sustainability</strong> and <strong>security</strong>, as the way to reduce costs, GHG emissions and its dependency from Russia, the EU’s major energy trade partner. Along the years, the EU has been trying through numerous legislative and other efforts<a href=\"#_ftn11\" name=\"_ftnref11\">[11]</a> to ensure competitive prices for its citizens, establish itself as a global leader in the fight against climate change and achieve greater energy independence.\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nThough, no matter the perspective from which the topic of energy is approached - as a public good, a necessity for economic growth, a demand and supply cycle, a polluting or a geopolitical factor - there is one defining parameter that affects all the above; we are yet to find a cost-effective way to <em>transmit</em> and most importantly <em>store<a href=\"#_ftn12\" name=\"_ftnref12\"><strong>[12]</strong></a></em> electrical energy at a large scale. Consequently, the cost for infrastructural development needed for market integration, the volatility of the RES<a href=\"#_ftn13\" name=\"_ftnref13\">[13]</a> and the lack of sufficient energy resources within the EU pose significant challenges when it comes to the future of European energy. In parallel, gas transmission in the form of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) is advancing.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt the same time, as energy policy is a shared competence between the EU and its Member States<a href=\"#_ftn14\" name=\"_ftnref14\">[14]</a>, there is great diversification among the latter in terms of energy prices, wholesale electricity and gas market structures and energy mixes, despite the significant steps that have been made already since the 1990s, marking the beginning of the market liberalisation<a href=\"#_ftn15\" name=\"_ftnref15\">[15]</a>. This diversification is depicted in the Member States’ energy systems functioning as ‘energy islands’; isolated, counterproductive and disadvantaged<a href=\"#_ftn16\" name=\"_ftnref16\">[16]</a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The ‘energy union’ idea</span>\n\nThe proposal of an ‘energy union’ is not brand new; in 2010 an idea for a ‘European Energy Community’ was proposed by former EC President Jacque Delors and former president of the European Parliament (EP) Jerzy Buzek<a href=\"#_ftn17\" name=\"_ftnref17\">[17]</a>. Moreover, the announcement of think-big energy plans that are eventually abandoned<a href=\"#_ftn18\" name=\"_ftnref18\">[18]</a> is a pattern for newly-appointed EC.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe Commission has taken a more holistic approach to Tusk’s idea, striping down the strong focus on security to milder/ voluntary mechanism proposals and throwing in vague references to RES and climate. The plan comes with five interlocking dimensions:\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong>Security</strong>: Despite the fact that unlike 2006 and 2009<a href=\"#_ftn19\" name=\"_ftnref19\">[19]</a> the Russian-Ukrainian crisis has not given any signs of gas supply dispute, it has “brought security to the forefront”, as the issue of resources is tied with external relations.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Completion of the internal market</strong>: Following the three Energy Packages<a href=\"#_ftn20\" name=\"_ftnref20\">[20]</a>, the EC is pushing the idea of cross-border interconnections and fully integrated wholesale and retail energy markets, in order to achieve price convergence and maximise profit.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Climate</strong>: Having already agreed to the 2030 Climate and Energy Framework<a href=\"#_ftn21\" name=\"_ftnref21\">[21]</a>, this dimension focuses on energy efficiency of buildings, products and possibly vehicles.</li>\n\t<li><strong>RES</strong>: The strategy will also include the communication of the EU’s negotiating positions for the United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in Paris 2015<a href=\"#_ftn22\" name=\"_ftnref22\">[22]</a>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Research and innovation</strong>: Smart technology, smart energy and smart cities are priorities for building the energy future of Europe, while it seems other technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) are also relegated to this dimension.</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\nThe timing of the strategy<a href=\"#_ftn23\" name=\"_ftnref23\">[23]</a> seems ideal; Europe is energy secure for this winter<a href=\"#_ftn24\" name=\"_ftnref24\">[24]</a>, gas and oil prices are at a historic low level<a href=\"#_ftn25\" name=\"_ftnref25\">[25]</a>, possibly allowing for investments in much-needed infrastructure build-up. and the US is having an energy revolution of its own, investing massively in shale gas and oil (‘fracking’)<a href=\"#_ftn26\" name=\"_ftnref26\">[26]</a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n\t<li><strong> Key questions</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Is Juncker’s ‘Energy Union’ a “secret sauce for energy recipe” or simply covering the cracks of the <em>trilemma</em> between sustainability, competitiveness and security without any real bite?</li>\n\t<li>What role should the Member States as political decision-makers have in international energy affairs?</li>\n\t<li>Is the diversification of suppliers ensuring in any way energy independence in the long term?</li>\n\t<li>Whereas wholesale electricity prices declined by one third between 2008 and 2012, should retail prices become a priority beyond tackling ‘energy poverty’?</li>\n\t<li>Are the climate and energy targets for 2030 a sufficient intermediary step between Europe 2020 and the EU’s Roadmap for moving to a low-carbon economy in 2050<a href=\"#_ftn27\" name=\"_ftnref27\">[27]</a>?</li>\n\t<li>How should the strategy on technologies such as smart grids look like? What further policies need to be adopted in order to ensure a smart, sustainable future?</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n\t<li><strong> Key facts and figures</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Today, the EU imports 53% of the energy it consumes. Energy import dependency relates to crude oil (almost 90%), to natural gas (66%), and to a lesser extent to solid fuels (42%) as well as nuclear fuel (40%).</li>\n\t<li>The EU external energy bill represents more than €1 billion per day (around €400 billion in 2013) and more than a fifth of total EU imports. The EU imports more than €300 billion of crude oil and oil products, of which one third come directly from Russia<a href=\"#_ftn28\" name=\"_ftnref28\">[28]</a>.</li>\n\t<li>Whilst Europe's energy system would require investments of ca. €1 trillion by 2020, it is estimated that about €200 billion of this investment is needed for electricity and gas networks of European importance alone. €100 billion of this investment should be delivered by the market unaided, whereas the other €100 billion will require public action to leverage the necessary investments<a href=\"#_ftn29\" name=\"_ftnref29\">[29]</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n\t<li><strong> Key actors</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nThe new <strong>EC</strong>, apart from<strong> Directorate-General (DG) for Energy </strong>and the Climate Action and Energy portfolio of Commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete, has also appointed Maroš Šefčovič as its Vice President on Energy Union. The new energy union strategy will naturally follow the Ordinary Legislative Procedure.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSince the Third Energy Package, the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators – the <strong>Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER)</strong> and the European Networks for Trasmission System Operators<strong> ENTSO-E<a href=\"#_ftn30\" name=\"_ftnref30\"><strong>[30]</strong></a> </strong>&amp;<strong> ENTSO-G </strong>have responsibilities over regulation and transmission system operation<a href=\"#_ftn31\" name=\"_ftnref31\">[31]</a>.\n\nIn the framework of the Organisation for Economic and Cooperation and Development, the <strong>International Energy Agency</strong> operates as a policy advisor for energy to its Member States.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe <strong>European Trade Union Confederation</strong>, <strong>Eurogas</strong>, representing the interests of the gas industry and the Union of the Electricity Industry, <strong>Eurelectric</strong>, the sector association which represents the common interests of the electricity industry, <strong>Euroheat &amp; Power</strong>, the international association representing the District Heating and Cooling and Combined Heat and Power sector, the <strong>European Wind Energy Association</strong>, as the voice of the wind industry, the <strong>European Photovoltaic Industry Association</strong>, as well as<strong> Foratom, </strong>the trade association for the nuclear energy industry in Europe<a href=\"#_ftn32\" name=\"_ftnref32\">[32]</a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe <strong>Green 10</strong>, that are ten of the largest environmental organisations and networks active on the European level and the <strong>European Alliance to Save Energy</strong>.\n\nThe EU’s traditional strategic oil and gas suppliers; Russia, Norway, the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Algeria, as well as LNG suppliers.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"6\">\n\t<li><strong> Key conflicts</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nA major conflict is that of the definition of energy security. While some countries are fairly independent on Russian gas, others such as Germany having ensured an advantaged negotiating position<a href=\"#_ftn33\" name=\"_ftnref33\">[33]</a> and the highly dependent Baltic countries and Poland, it is evident that common ground might be far from any actionable proposal. While one side pushes for enhanced coordination when negotiating prices with Gazprom and solidarity mechanisms in cases of emergency, there is a potential conflict with free market and competition rules.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt the same time, the different levels of RES market penetration among Member States could potentially hinder the decarbonisation process based on RES schemes<a href=\"#_ftn34\" name=\"_ftnref34\">[34]</a> or even the process as a whole, as proposals on shale gas and oil exploitation as well as indigenous coal production are on the table.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnother legitimate question is whether stronger focus on energy efficiency can result in diversification of suppliers, considering that Europe will remain energy dependent for a long time. Moreover, with a minimal budget allocated for energy infrastructure projects, cost may be the decision-making factor in new projects.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEU energy security has also to be seen in the context of growing energy demand worldwide, which is expected to increase by 27% by 2030, with important changes to energy supply and trade flows<a href=\"#_ftn35\" name=\"_ftnref35\">[35]</a>.\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n\t<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nThe European legislation addressing the issue of the creation and development of the electricity and gas market is grouped into three different Packages, which were issued in 1996-8, 2003 and 2009 respectively. The 2009/72/ΕC &amp; 2009/73/EC Directives of the EP and of the Council set common rules for the functioning of electricity and gas markets in the EU, as a first step toward a single European energy market (Third Energy Package). The Package covers five main areas<a href=\"#_ftn36\" name=\"_ftnref36\">[36]</a>:\n<ul>\n\t<li>unbundling energy suppliers from network operators;</li>\n\t<li>strengthening the independence of energy regulators;</li>\n\t<li>establishment of the ACER;</li>\n\t<li>cross-border cooperation between transmission system operators and the creation of European Networks for Transmission System Operators;</li>\n\t<li>increased transparency in retail markets to benefit consumers.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nThe current EU energy strategy comes under Europe 2020<a href=\"#_ftn37\" name=\"_ftnref37\">[37]</a> and the so-called 20-20-20 targets, along with its continuation through the 2030 climate and energy framework. An integral part of the climate strategies is the EU’s Emissions Trading Scheme<a href=\"#_ftn38\" name=\"_ftnref38\">[38]</a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe EU has identified a number of priority energy infrastructure projects under its Trans-European Networks (TEN-E) strategy (priority corridors)<a href=\"#_ftn39\" name=\"_ftnref39\">[39]</a>. Based on the priority corridors, the EU drew up a list of projects of common interest. It updates this list every two years. The selected projects can take advantage of a number of benefits including faster permitting procedures and applying for funding from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) – the EU's €50 billion plan for boosting energy, transport, and digital infrastructure between 2014 and 2020. €5.85 billion from the CEF amount to energy projects for 2014-2020.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe vision of an energy-interconnected Europe<a href=\"#_ftn40\" name=\"_ftnref40\">[40]</a> is to be carried out by strengthening <strong>cross-border energy trade</strong><a href=\"#_ftn41\" name=\"_ftnref41\">[41]</a> toward price convergence and security of supply. Through the 2030 Climate and Energy Framework, the Member States are asked to ensure a level of electricity interconnections equivalent to or beyond 15% of their installed production capacity.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHowever, apart from building large-scale transmission cables and gas pipelines (‘hardware’), the ‘software’ development needed entails harmonising the different tax and regulatory systems among the Member States. As energy taxation varies greatly -mainly due to national subsidy schemes for RES, the EC prioritises regulatory harmonisation, with the development of network codes. As the EC has aligned, national decisions are negatively affecting neighbour interests, a regional approach is needed “even if it is perceived that these decisions must be taken predominantly on a national level”. Main points of conflict are RES subsidy schemes and capacity mechanisms. The EU-wide market rules for full integration- known as the Target Model<a href=\"#_ftn42\" name=\"_ftnref42\">[42]</a> – might also need to be revised to reward flexibility and further improve the cost-efficient integration of variable energy into the grid.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The energy hardware and software of the future</span>\n\nThe RES integration into the energy grid is currently dependent on subsidies, with the cost being passed to the consumers. The promise of the ‘smart grid’<a href=\"#_ftn43\" name=\"_ftnref43\">[43]</a> is to enable a new paradigm with a reduced energy cost while getting RES in the game. The challenge is to make this work while maintaining the quality of life; as consumers become also generators; houses are turned into half-households half-industries and the demand side is managed dynamically.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"8\">\n\t<li><strong> Links for further research</strong></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Energy union</em>\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>Latvian Presidency: The Energy Union Conference of the EU Energy Ministers: <a href=\"https://eu2015.lv/events/political-meetings/the-energy-union-conference-of-the-eu-energy-ministers-2015-02-06\">https://eu2015.lv/events/political-meetings/the-energy-union-conference-of-the-eu-energy-ministers-2015-02-06</a></li>\n\t<li>Leaked internal Commission document for the orientation debate of the energy union strategy: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bzzk5QQezBErQ2N4ZXMxWU03TWM/view?pli=1\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bzzk5QQezBErQ2N4ZXMxWU03TWM/view?pli=1</a></li>\n\t<li><em>Financial Times: </em>“‘Energy union’ ambitions already scaled back?”: \u00a0\u00a0 <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/brusselsblog/2015/02/04/energy-union-ambitions-already-scaled-back/\">http://blogs.ft.com/brusselsblog/2015/02/04/energy-union-ambitions-already-scaled-back/</a></li>\n\t<li><em>Energy Post: </em>“The Energy Union: it’s now or never for a European energy policy”: <a href=\"http://www.energypost.eu/energy-union-now-never-european-energy-policy/\">http://www.energypost.eu/energy-union-now-never-european-energy-policy/</a></li>\n\t<li><em>The Guardian: </em>“European energy regulations could be strengthened under commission plans”: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/06/european-energy-regulations-could-be-strengthened-under-commission-plans\">http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/06/european-energy-regulations-could-be-strengthened-under-commission-plans</a></li>\n\t<li><em>Carbon Brief</em>: “Briefing: What is the EU's energy union?”: <a href=\"http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2015/02/briefing-what-is-the-eus-energy-union/\">http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2015/02/briefing-what-is-the-eus-energy-union/</a></li>\n\t<li><em>Spectator: </em>“Jean-Claude Juncker’s biggest challenge: energy”: <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2014/07/jean-claude-junckers-biggest-challenge-energy/\">http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2014/07/jean-claude-junckers-biggest-challenge-energy/</a></li>\n\t<li><em>Forbes: </em>“The Role Of The New European Energy Union”: <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2015/02/09/the-role-of-the-new-european-energy-union/\">http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2015/02/09/the-role-of-the-new-european-energy-union/</a></li>\n\t<li><em>Oil Price</em>: “EU Pushes For Greater Integration Into An Energy Union”: <a href=\"http://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/EU-Pushes-For-Greater-Integration-Into-An-Energy-Union.html\">http://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/EU-Pushes-For-Greater-Integration-Into-An-Energy-Union.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n\n<em>Internal market</em>\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li><em>Financial Times: </em>“EU energy market: Pipe dream”: <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c6dd6c38-ea3c-11e3-afb3-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=intl#axzz3Qbky3j5N\">http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c6dd6c38-ea3c-11e3-afb3-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=intl#axzz3Qbky3j5N</a></li>\n\t<li>European Commission press release:<strong> “</strong>Common rules and Infrastructure needed to complete Energy Market”: <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-1124_en.htm\">http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-1124_en.htm</a></li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\n<em>On efficiency, competitiveness and security</em>\n\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n<ul>\n\t<li><em>The Carbon Brief</em>: “Seven charts showing how the EU's energy use is being transformed”: <a href=\"http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2015/02/seven-charts-showing-how-the-eus-energy-use-is-being-transformed/\">http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2015/02/seven-charts-showing-how-the-eus-energy-use-is-being-transformed/</a></li>\n\t<li><em>Foreign Policy: </em>“Europe’s Energy Independence Drive Goes off the Rails”: <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/02/05/europes-energy-independence-drive-goes-off-the-rails-shale-poland-uk-russia-gas/\">http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/02/05/europes-energy-independence-drive-goes-off-the-rails-shale-poland-uk-russia-gas/</a></li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\"><em><strong>[1]</strong></em></a><em> Kaplan, S.

As the most celebrated achievement of the Union amongst Europeans, it provides the right to work and reside in any country of the EU and the European Economic Area, as well as Switzerland<strong>. </strong>Nonetheless, while the European Commission is taking action to further enforce freedom of movement within Member States, certain national governments are posing significant threats to the practicalities of its implementation, stressing on its negative effects on a national level. Therefore, the debate on curtailing freedom of movement will be at the heart of the policy agenda of the Juncker Commission, which started its work last November.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFree movement of persons and workers, as established in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\">[3]</a>, sets the basis for the European citizenship and for the European common labour market. In fact, as part of the free movement principle, citizens are entitled to:\n<ul>\n\t<li>look for a job in another EU country;</li>\n\t<li>work there without needing a work permit;</li>\n\t<li>reside in another country whilst seeking work;</li>\n\t<li>stay in that country even after employment there has come to an end;</li>\n\t<li>enjoy equal treatment with nationals with regard to access to employment, working conditions and all other social and tax advantages.<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\">[4]</a></li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is only possible through the compromise of all Member States, who follow the European legislation in order to include European citizens in their respective welfare systems through common administrative procedures. In this sense, each Member State remains free to scheme its social security system independently, while being integrated in the European legislation.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSome of the academic literature noted three distinct phases of free movement.<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\">[5]</a> Prior to the 2004 and 2007 enlargements, most movements were small scale and regional, for example, between Member States with close historical links. Following the 2004 enlargement, the second phase of EU migration saw very large numbers of, in many cases unanticipated, movements from east to west; and the third phase has seen an initial decline in east-west migration following the economic crisis, with some evidence of a new south-north trend in movement of workers from the crisis hit Member States of the south to the more prosperous north.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCriticism has been raised regarding the effects of free movement of persons and workers on national welfare systems, labour markets and social integration in several Member States. Accordingly, EU immigrants are seen as a threat to social security systems, as said systems can get overloaded by an increasing number of users, with negative repercussions on the national citizens’ coverage. Also, internal migration fluxes have relevant effects on national labour markets, pressure on wage levels, and job-related benefits.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn the context of high unemployment rates and an enlarged European common area, the EU has to produce a response to aforementioned critical positions and find ways to mitigate the negative consequences of freedom of movement, whilst granting this fundamental right to all European citizens.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"3\">\n\t<li><strong> Key questions</strong></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>Is it possible for Member States to limit access to social security without a ground on nationality-based discrimination?</li>\n\t<li>What possible restrictions can a government put upon its own welfare system?</li>\n\t<li>What are the legal limits for reforming freedom of movement and its consequences for European citizens?</li>\n\t<li>Could further social integration reduce citizens’ negative opinions on the immigration’s impact on social security systems?</li>\n\t<li>What should the European Commission’s next steps be towards protecting freedom of movement while accommodating critical demands raised by Member States?</li>\n\t<li>What is the role of European citizens in this debate?</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n\t<li><strong> Key facts and figures</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>56% of the Union citizens consider free movement of people, goods and services to be the most positive result of the EU.<a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\">[6]</a></li>\n\t<li>At the end of 2012, 14.1 million EU citizens were residing in another Member State for less than one year (2.8% of the total population).<a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\">[7]</a></li>\n\t<li>Non-active EU mobile citizens represent a very small share of the total population in each Member State and between 0.7% and 1.0% of the overall EU population.<a href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\">[8]</a></li>\n\t<li>For the EU as a whole, the GDP effect of recent intra-EU mobility flows is equivalent to a collective income gain of around 24 billion EUR for EU citizens.<a href=\"#_ftn9\" name=\"_ftnref9\">[9]</a></li>\n\t<li>One in four (27%) citizens residing in another EU country report problems and almost one in two (47%) say that staff in local administrations do not have sufficient information about their EU rights.<a href=\"#_ftn10\" name=\"_ftnref10\">[10]</a></li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"5\">\n\t<li><strong> Key actors</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>The <strong>European Commission</strong> sees effective freedom of movement as a key solution to some of the current shortcomings of the European internal market.

In this sense, critical Member States try to introduce their concerns in the Council’s agenda. The joint letter between Germany, the UK, Austria and The Netherlands is a good example of such functioning.<a href=\"#_ftn17\" name=\"_ftnref17\">[17]</a></li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nThe <strong>United Kingdom </strong>is the Member State arguing most strongly in favour of curtailing freedom of movement. Indeed, David Cameron has sent an ultimatum threatening to leave the EU if reforms restraining free movement do not take place, and has proposed three key actions in order to reduce the European immigration to the UK.<a href=\"#_ftn18\" name=\"_ftnref18\">[18]</a> Nonetheless, many see those severe declarations as an intent of the Conservatives to gain electorate from the far right party UKIP, whose speech against immigration is increasingly attracting voters during the run up to the May 2015 general elections.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Civil society</strong>, conformed by citizens and private organisations, is also to be taken into consideration, as it plays a crucial role in defining governments’ agendas. In fact, <strong>public opinion</strong> and electorate interests are likely to define governments’ guidelines; while the so-called <strong>opinion generators</strong>, like the media or social studies companies, present arguments in favour of or against certain opinions, impregnating the discussion on freedom of movement.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"6\">\n\t<li><strong> Key conflicts</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nAs discussed above, one could argue governments declaring interest in curtailing freedom of movement may be doing so, primarily for gaining electoral support ahead of national elections. If this is to be the case, free movement is being held hostage to politics for election-winning purposes. Nonetheless, problems related to immigration are some of the more serious concerns of many Europeans<a href=\"#_ftn19\" name=\"_ftnref19\">[19]</a>, hence, there seems to be evidence of genuine concern of European citizens in certain Member States.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOn another note, Member States express worries over possible “social dumping”, the potential abuse of welfare systems and the financial burden that inactive migrants may put on welfare systems in the receiving countries. The European Commission, however, is less prone to raise awareness on those fears, finding evidence that they have small effects on national welfare systems and labour markets. Despite the limitations to free residence already included in the treaties, national welfares demand more protection against such dangers in order to assure effective, yet possible freedom of movement.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRestricting freedom of movement, however, is not a simple endeavour. Indeed, it would require either a treaty amendment, with the subsequent unanimity requirement; or a set of directives from the Commission. For this reason, the Commission remains specially careful on the possibility that such limitations do not take place on the basis of nation-based discrimination, promoting social inclusion for migrants both within civil society and public administration decisions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAdditionally, the Commission is concerned with the lack of correct implementation of free movement on national, regional and local levels, and understands this lack of accurate application to be a core problem for the achievement of effective freedom of movement. The lack of correct understanding and insufficient evaluation of public policies are on the cornerstone of controversies. In this sense, discussions do not remain on the principle itself as they do in the way it is put into practice by national governments.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"7\">\n\t<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\nThe overall strategy of the EU consists of fostering workers’ internal mobility, while ensuring correct application of the European legislation on freedom of movement in order to reduce both potential social security fraud and unjustified limitations of the principle. Hence, concrete measures have been already implemented in the fields of social security and labour market.\n\nFirstly, EU legislation limits free movement of citizens’ from recently adherent Member States. Indeed, the Stockholm Programme set transitional measures from 2010 to 2014 aiming to limit the impact of Bulgaria and Romania adhesions on the common European area, through transitional integration measures applied on citizens from both countries who migrated to work and live abroad. Building on the achievements of\u00a0the programme, the same strategy is currently being applied for the transitional integration of Croatia, who became the 28th Member State on July 2013.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMoreover, through social security coordination, the Barroso Commission presented the European Citizenship Report 2013, studying the possibility to extend the export period of unemployment benefits from the current 3 months to a minimum of 6 months. It also settled the framework to ensure that local administrations are given the tools to fully comprehend the free movement rights of EU citizens.<a href=\"#_ftn20\" name=\"_ftnref20\">[20]</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn addition to those measures, the European Commission took action to further improve the application of free movement through the publication of the Guide on Habitual Residence Test, a tool for Member States to acknowledge who is responsible for the provision of social security benefits in particular cases, helping governments prevent abuses from social welfare systems. Furthermore, the European Social Fund dedicates 20% of its national expense provisions on social inclusion for disadvantaged collectives, such as internal immigrants.<a href=\"#_ftn21\" name=\"_ftnref21\">[21]</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe second set of measures are aimed at homogenising national labour market conditions in order to limit migration impacts. In addition to open-method coordination between Member States and EU institutions, the European Commission monitors the European employment strategy for EU countries to share information, discuss and coordinate their employment policies. Although this strategy contains numerous measures to reduce unemployment, it is still highly relevant for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs I, as it provides Member States with the chance to improve inclusion of European migrants in their labour markets. This strategy analyses the development of the European labour market through the annual publication of a joint employment report, as well as provides country-specific recommendations issued by the Commission.<a href=\"#_ftn22\" name=\"_ftnref22\">[22]</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLikewise, the Commission, in co-operation with the Public Employment Services of the EEA Member States (and Switzerland) manage the European Employment Services (EURES), the biggest job mobility portal for EU workers. Around 150.000 jobseekers per year get a job or job offer via EURES, according to official data.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFinally, the Junker Commission has already defined the creation of a new directive on facilitating the exercise of rights in the context of free movement of workers, to be in implemented on May 2016. The directive aims, among others, to assure national bodies are ready and in place, able to provide better information on the right of free movement, as well as more general support and assistance to Union workers and their families. <a href=\"#_ftn23\" name=\"_ftnref23\">[23]</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"8\">\n\t<li><strong> Links for further research</strong></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Official sites and studies</em>\n\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n<ul>\n\t<li>EURES official website <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eures/main.jsp?acro=eures&amp;lang=en&amp;catId=1&amp;parentId=0\">https://ec.europa.eu/eures/main.jsp?acro=eures&amp;lang=en&amp;catId=1&amp;parentId=0</a></li>\n\t<li>Official Press: <em>European Commission upholds free movement of people</em></li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-1041_en.htm\">http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-1041_en.htm</a>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Official Press: <em>Free movement: Commission publishes guide on application of ‘Habitual Residence Test’ for social security</em></li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-13_en.htm\">http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-13_en.htm</a>\n<ul>\n\t<li>The Stockholm Program explained <a href=\"http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/human_rights/fundamental_rights_within_european_union/jl0034_en.htm\">http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/human_rights/fundamental_rights_within_european_union/jl0034_en.htm</a></li>\n\t<li>Conference for mayors on EU mobility at local level</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/justice/events/intra-eu-mobility-2014/index_en.htm\">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/events/intra-eu-mobility-2014/index_en.htm</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Press releases</em>\n\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n<ul>\n\t<li>The Telegraph: <em>No, Angela Merkel hasn't issued an 'ultimatum' to David Cameron over EU migrants </em><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/angela-merkel/11205220/No-Angela-Merkel-hasnt-issued-an-ultimatum-to-David-Cameron-over-EU-migrants.html\">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/angela-merkel/11205220/No-Angela-Merkel-hasnt-issued-an-ultimatum-to-David-Cameron-over-EU-migrants.html</a></li>\n\t<li>Euractiv: <em>'Benefits tourism' in the EU is a myth, report says</em></li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://www.euractiv.com/socialeurope/little-evidence-benefit-tourism-news-531128\">http://www.euractiv.com/socialeurope/little-evidence-benefit-tourism-news-531128</a>\n<ul>\n\t<li>BBC News: <em>Q&amp;A: EU freedom of movement</em></li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25237742\">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25237742</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Other sources</em>\n\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Interesting study on the importance of free movement for the accomplishment of Europe 2020 objectives (pages 15 to 17) <a href=\"http://doisrpska.nub.rs/index.php/economyandmarket/article/download/1386/1290\">http://doisrpska.nub.rs/index.php/economyandmarket/article/download/1386/1290</a></li>\n\t<li>Critical study on the European Council guidelines on freedom of movement (pages 2 to 16) <a href=\"http://www.ceps.eu/system/files/SC%20EG%20AFSJ%20Guidelines%202020.pdf\">http://www.ceps.eu/system/files/SC%20EG%20AFSJ%20Guidelines%202020.pdf</a></li>\n\t<li>UK Government: <em>Review of the Balance of Competences between the United Kingdom and the European Union Single Market: Free Movement of Persons</em> (to further understand UK arguments on freedom of movement)</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/335088/SingleMarketFree_MovementPersons.pdf\">https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/335088/SingleMarketFree_MovementPersons.pdf</a>\n<ul>\n\t<li><em>Amending EU free movement law: What are the legal limits?</em> (A very interesting analysis by Steve Peers in the blog EU Law Analysis)</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://eulawanalysis.blogspot.com.es/2014/11/amending-eu-free-movement-law-what-are.html\">http://eulawanalysis.blogspot.com.es/2014/11/amending-eu-free-movement-law-what-are.html</a>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Video: <em>Moving within Europe -

Some motives to these and other religiously fuelled attacks are failed integration and social exclusion leading to intolerance and xenophobia in many Member States.<a href=\"#_ftn12\" name=\"_ftnref12\"><sup><sup>[12]</sup></sup></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhile attacks such as the ones in Paris and Copenhagen have increased, other extremist sentiments have also elevated. Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West (PEGIDA) is a German anti-Islam political organisation founded in Dresden in October 2014. PEGIDA organised weekly demonstrations during autumn 2014 against the Islamisation of Europe call for more restrictive immigration rules.<a href=\"#_ftn13\" name=\"_ftnref13\"><sup><sup>[13]</sup></sup></a> Supporters of PEGIDA say European citizens need to wake up and realise the threat from Islamist extremists and want a curbed immigration, accusing German authorities of failing to enforce the laws. PEGIDA and similar anti-immigration movements attract a vast variety of right-wing groups, but also ordinary citizens worrying about conservative Islam and its impact on society and culture. Many fear that further immigration is posing a threat to preservation of European culture and values.<a href=\"#_ftn14\" name=\"_ftnref14\"><sup><sup>[14]</sup></sup></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRight-wing movements have seen an increased momentum in the past few years with several right-wing parties being elected at the European, National and Regional level. In the European Parliament elections in 2014, right-wing parties such as the National Front (France) and UKIP (United Kingdom) saw an all-time high in popularity<a href=\"#_ftn15\" name=\"_ftnref15\"><sup><sup>[15]</sup></sup></a><a href=\"#_ftn16\" name=\"_ftnref16\"><sup><sup>[16]</sup></sup></a>. This manifests a rise in anti-immigration sentiments and xenophobia in the EU. Right-wing extremism is interesting to this topic because it showcases a lack of tolerance towards other cultures in Member States. At the same time, free and democratic societies allow sentiments of said nature to also flourish, within set parameters and laws.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn fact, what individuals are and are not allowed to say varies in different countries with different hate speech and defamation laws in Member States. The question of harmonising free speech legislation is brought up especially with regards to internet safety and publications online as an increasing amount of communication takes place over the internet.<a href=\"#_ftn17\" name=\"_ftnref17\"><sup><sup>[17]</sup></sup></a>\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n\t<li><strong> Key questions</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Should there be limitations to freedom of speech and religion?

United Kingdom and France are two striking examples to this.</li>\n\t<li>In 2014, 47 violations to the European Convention on Human Rights regarding freedom of expression were reported in France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Italy, Switzerland, Slovenia and Turkey. 24 of these were reported in Turkey.<a href=\"#_ftn21\" name=\"_ftnref21\"><sup><sup>[21]</sup></sup></a></li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n\t<li><strong> Key actors</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\n<strong>European institutions</strong> - Although the EU has limited competences with regards to civil liberties, much of it is constituted in the the <strong>Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU</strong> and the <strong>ECHR. The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) </strong>is an international court set up in 1959 ruling on State or Individual applications alleging violations of civil and political rights set out in the ECHR. The ECtHR monitors respect for the human rights of 800 million Europeans in 47 <strong>Council of Europe</strong> Member States that have ratified the Convention.<a href=\"#_ftn22\" name=\"_ftnref22\"><sup><sup>[22]</sup></sup></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>National governments</strong> – Civil liberties such as freedom of expression and of thought, conscience and religion is regulated in national constitution and penal/criminal code. There is no fixed practice across Member States but adherence to international charters and conventions is common.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Right-wing movements - </strong>Right-wing organisations with political purpose and political parties elected into European and National institutions are main drivers in targeting hate towards religious and social groups. There is a disagreement over what unites the extreme-right (or radical-right) parties, but anti-immigrant sentiment is the most common ideological theme. Racism, ethnocentrism, anti-immigration and welfare chauvinism are the policies that most characterize relatively successful extreme-right parties.<a href=\"#_ftn23\" name=\"_ftnref23\"><sup><sup>[23]</sup></sup></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Citizens, religion practitioners, NGOs and social groups (such as immigrants) - </strong>The receivers and users of civil liberties.\n\n<strong>The Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA)</strong> - one of the EU’s decentralised agencies providing expert advice to the institutions of the EU and the Member States. The FRA helps to ensure that the fundamental rights of people living in the EU are protected.<a href=\"#_ftn24\" name=\"_ftnref24\"><sup><sup>[24]</sup></sup></a>\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n\t<li><strong> Key conflicts</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nThere can be confusion between freedom of expression and respect for non-discrimination and the diversity of religious and non-religious beliefs. Freedom of expression includes the right to be critical and disparaging of religions or religious practices. However, international instruments draw a clear line on this dichotomy, prohibiting any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence.<a href=\"#_ftn25\" name=\"_ftnref25\">[25]</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHow can civil liberties be adapted to European citizens; to find a balance where everyone has the freedom to express themselves, while at the same time not feeling attacked by these same rights. Are certain limitations necessary to achieve this? If so, what should these limitations be? Certain limitations already exist (see ‘Measures already in place’ below), such as ban on insulting a state, flag or president. Because of this there is technically no limitless freedom of speech in the EU as all Member States have variations to international conventions and charters in their national legislation.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSimilarly, one needs to consider the reasons for sentiments leading to certain opinions and explore why and how such extremist movements emerge and grow. In Germany, two attempts have been made to ban the neonazi-party NPD with the German Constitutional Court.<a href=\"#_ftn26\" name=\"_ftnref26\"><sup><sup>[26]</sup></sup></a>\u00a0 How efficient are limitations and bans in addressing these issues? While a ban of such a political party would lead to a less sophisticated organisation, the people with supporting sentiments will still remain. In other words, the idea itself that is at the core of the issue is not tackled. What are the happenings in society that favour the development of these sentiments?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSome research point to that anti-immigration sentiments are rooted in intolerance and competition for scarce resources as a result of economic deprivation. One issue with this idea is that anti-immigration sentiment is found in all social classes.<a href=\"#_ftn27\" name=\"_ftnref27\"><sup><sup>[27]</sup></sup></a> Other research point to that people who oppose immigration seem to fear that the newcomers will change the group’s identity and fail to contribute to the country as a whole. Policymakers could look into ways of showing native-born people that immigrants are not very different, and therefore not a threat to cultural identity, rather than focusing on monetary incentives and jobs.<a href=\"#_ftn28\" name=\"_ftnref28\"><sup><sup>[28]</sup></sup></a> Social scientists describe xenophobia as one of many reactions generated by anomic situations in modern societies. However, xenophobic or racist reactions are not necessarily aggravated by the presence of a large number of immigrants. There are examples showing that social decline of specific groups and right-wing political organisations are sufficient preconditions for the emergence of xenophobia.<a href=\"#_ftn29\" name=\"_ftnref29\"><sup><sup>[29]</sup></sup></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMuch of the intolerance is rooted in lack of understanding. The EU is a pluralistic area in terms of religion but the main religion in most Member States is Christianity.<a href=\"#_ftn30\" name=\"_ftnref30\"><sup><sup>[30]</sup></sup></a> Education and integration play crucial roles in ensuring a better understanding of different cultures and religions. How can education be developed to bridge this gap in understanding?\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n\t<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nFreedom of speech is covered in Article 19 in UDHR<sup> <a href=\"#_ftn31\" name=\"_ftnref31\"><sup>[31]</sup></a></sup>, Article 11 in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU<a href=\"#_ftn32\" name=\"_ftnref32\"><sup><sup>[32]</sup></sup></a> and Chapter 10 in the ECHR<a href=\"#_ftn33\" name=\"_ftnref33\"><sup><sup>[33]</sup></sup></a>.

Freedom of speech is granted explicit protection in international law by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which is binding in 150 nations<a href=\"#_ftn38\" name=\"_ftnref38\"><sup><sup>[38]</sup></sup></a>. All Member States in the EU are signatories of the ECHR in addition to having constitutional and legal rights to freedom of expression on the national level.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">No hate speech movement</span></em>\n\nNo hate speech movement is a project by the Council of Europe for human rights online and against the expression of hate speech in all forms. It is based on human rights education, youth participation and media literacy and aims at reducing hate speech and combating discrimination and racism online and offline. It aims to achieve this by raising awareness through creative solution by equipping youth organisations and young people with knowledge and competences to recognise and act against human rights violations.<a href=\"#_ftn39\" name=\"_ftnref39\"><sup><sup>[39]</sup></sup></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">United Nations </span></em>\n\nOn the day of its fiftieth anniversary, in 1995, UN’s Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization’s Member States adopted a Declaration of Principles on Tolerance. Education for tolerance should aim at countering influences that lead to fear and exclusion of others and help young people develop capacities for independent judgement, critical thinking and ethical reasoning. The UNESCO suggests 5 steps to achieve more tolerance between people of different religions, cultures and ethnicities. These are through law, education, access to information individual awareness and local solutions.<a href=\"#_ftn40\" name=\"_ftnref40\"><sup><sup>[40]</sup></sup></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI)</span></em>\n\nECRI is a body of the Council of Europe entrusted with the task of combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, anti-semitism and intolerance in Europe from the perspective of the protection of human rights, in the light of the ECHR, its additional protocols and related case-law.

They are similar to other forms of digital money; however they differ in a few key points. First of all, virtual currencies do not have a physical counterpart with legal tender status. Another important difference lays in the fact that traditional financial institutions are not involved, as such they are not regulated by central banks like other currencies are; virtual currencies are issued by private, non-financial institutions. For these reasons, the relation between virtual currencies and traditional currencies is not regulated by law.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nVirtual currency schemes can be divided into three types. The first type is called “closed virtual currency scheme”. These schemes do not have a strong link to real economies, and are usually used in gaming communities. Users usually pay subscription fees, and then earn credits based on their performance. Said credits can only be used to buy goods in the game. The second type is called “virtual currency schemes with unidirectional flow”. This type of virtual currency enables users to buy virtual currencies using a traditional currency, but cannot exchange it back to the original currency. The third and last type is called “virtual currency schemes with bidirectional flows”. These kind of virtual currencies are the ones that resemble the most to our concept of usual currencies; they can be exchanged in both directions, as well as can be used to buy not only virtual goods and services, but also real ones. One example of such a currency is Bitcoin.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBased on these schemes, it is understandable that virtual currencies are constantly evolving, and they start to resemble traditional currencies in many ways. Given the increased use of the internet over the years, it is imminent that they will become an important payment method in the near future. The main benefits are related to the transactions. Most virtual currencies function as peer-to-peer schemes, making transactions very similar to real, private transactions between two individuals. Using virtual currencies enable fast transactions, because no bank approval is needed when sharing a message signed with a private key to perform transaction. Since there is no intermediate third party (e.g. a bank), no transaction fees need to be paid by either of the contracting parties, thereby making the usage of virtual currencies much cheaper in comparison to other currencies. For aforementioned reasons, many people and companies are turning to these innovative methods of payment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHowever, the nature of virtual currencies shows a lot of vulnerability to potential threats. From the citizens’ perspective, fraud remains the main issue. Virtual currencies are used for anonymous transactions and bear the risk of loss because fraudulent exchanges. Another example of fraud related to virtual currencies can be pump-and-dump schemes<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a>. Furthermore, the risk of considerable amounts of a virtual currency being removed from the market due to hacking is present. For this reason, the exchange rates for the “virtual currency schemes with bidirectional flows” can fluctuate, eventually leading to large losses for the users. Last but not least, the access to virtual currencies is guaranteed by a single so-called e-wallet; which can potentially be hacked. There is always the chance to use an e-wallet provider; however they remain private institutions and are also subject to cybercrimes. It is important to keep in mind the loss of private keys seems like an irreversible problem, since there is no possibility to access these once they are lost.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOn the other hand, the EU as a whole can also be damaged by actions of people who exploit the vulnerabilities of virtual currencies. Transactions using virtual currencies are anonymous, and this feature can be used in order to conduct criminal activities. Money laundry can be considered as one of the main issues; the Bitcoin protocol does not require providing identification and verification of customers. There is no central oversight body, so no Anti-Money Laundry software is currently available to monitor and identify suspicious transaction patterns. Law enforcement cannot target one central location or entity for investigative purposes. For the same reason, criminals can use virtual currencies to execute illegal payments or perform anonymous extortion. From an economic point of view, tax avoidance and the exchange rate fluctuations remain the most challenging issues. Fiscal regulations for virtual currencies are still undefined, which enables tax evasion through the use virtual currencies for purchases.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThese issues are not only presented from theoretical standpoint, their effects are already prevalent in reality. A striking example took place in the first months of 2012, when Bitcoin suffered a loss of 300.000 US dollars due to different hacking attacks. Furthermore, in January 2014 there was another massive cyber-attack, forcing several important online platforms to halt transactions. It is clear that the lack of regulations in the field is exploitable, and it is important to tackle the issue before virtual currencies obtain an even more prominent role in everyday life.\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n\t<li><strong> Key questions</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Should the EU intervene in order to regulate the use of virtual currencies, and if yes, under what legal bases?</li>\n\t<li>What regulations should the EU impose?</li>\n\t<li>How can the EU ensure that introduced regulations do not diminish the European market’s competitiveness on the global scene?</li>\n\t<li>If the EU does not produce regulatory legislation, what other measures can be taken with a view to minising the potential damage caused by virtual currencies?</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n\t<li><strong> Key facts and figures</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>There is currently no EU legislation in place regulating the use of virtual currencies.</li>\n\t<li>On December 2013 the European Banking Authority (EBA) issued a statement warning consumers on the risks of virtual currencies.<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\">[3]</a></li>\n\t<li>To this day, there are more than 500 virtual currency schemes, with a total market cap of more than 3.5 billion USD<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\">[4]</a>.</li>\n\t<li>Bitcoin is the most diffused virtual currency, accounting for around 80% of the total market cap.</li>\n\t<li>The number of virtual currencies transactions has never exceeded 110.000 per day<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\">[5]</a>, compared to approximately 295 million conventional payment and terminal transaction per day in Europe alone<a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\">[6]</a>.</li>\n\t<li>The number of internet users in the world at the end of 2000 was 361 million, while by the end of 2011 the number has increased to 2.267 million (approximately 33% of the global population)<a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\">[7]</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n\t<li><strong> Key actors</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\n<strong>European institutions</strong>, despite currently having limited regulatory powers, are the ones, which have to ensure the safe use of the virtual currencies in the single market. Since there is no regulation in place on the EU level, the <strong>European Commission</strong> (EC) will play a vital role in proposing legislation. The regulations can be included in the current work towards the <strong>Digital Single Market</strong>. Furthermore, another important institution is the <strong>Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection of the European Parliament</strong>. Both bodies can be supported by advice coming from the <strong>European Central Bank</strong> (ECB) and the <strong>European Banking Authority (</strong>EBA). One of the tasks of the EBA, in accordance with Article 9 of its founding regulation, is to monitor new and existing financial activities and to adopt guidelines and recommendations with a view to promoting the safety and soundness of markets.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>National governments</strong> have a less important role in this debate, since the internal market is an exclusive competence of the EU. However, they play a more important role in shaping national legislation, on issues pertaining to the use and taxation of virtual currencies. Furthermore, it is also their duty to ensure the implementation of the EU legislation.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>European citizens and companies</strong>, although not directly, are important stakeholders in this debate. They do not have any regulatory power; however they are the users of the virtual currencies, which give them a crucial role. Companies and citizens should be made aware of the potential dangers of virtual currencies’ usage.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Inventors, trade platforms </strong>and <strong>e-wallet<a href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\"><strong>[8]</strong></a> providers </strong>are also important and somewhat take over the banks’ roles in the field of virtual currencies. Any potential regulation imposed by the EU will be directly applied to them.\n\n&nbsp;\n<ol start=\"6\">\n\t<li><strong> Key conflicts</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nIt is possible to identify four main conflicts in the scope of the topic. First of all, it is important to determine whether the EU has enough <strong>legal bases </strong>to intervene in order to regulate the functioning of the virtual currencies. Although the ECB has already defined the different virtual currency schemes, it is still not clear up to which point the EU can regulate their functioning. Furthermore, it is also important to determine <strong>which institutions </strong>of the EU will be in charge of dealing with the different aspects of virtual currencies.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSecondly, there are <strong>different approaches</strong> the EU can take to tackle the issue of virtual currencies. One of them can be to simply define virtual currencies as a method of payment which should abide to legislation already in place regarding issues of money laundry, taxation etc. Another approach can be to implement new legislation specifically tailored to the features of virtual currency schemes. Also, one should not forget that neither of the two “extremes” are a good way forward for the EU: taking no action and leaving the situation as it is, or completely banning the use of virtual currencies.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs explained in the first section, virtual currencies can <strong>affect each citizen individually</strong>, as well as <strong>the EU in its entirety</strong>. Given the potential threats have a wide variety of effects; it would be difficult to immediately implement legislation regarding every single issue. Thus, it is key to decide which of these two aspects should be <strong>prioritized in the short term</strong>.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLast but not least, European companies are constantly <strong>competing in the global market</strong>, so any regulation regarding virtual currencies can potentially affect their competitiveness too. Therefore, it is important to keep in mind the different legislation in place in other countries outside Europe. Moreover, any EU level legislation should be introduced after consultation different stakeholders.\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n\t<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nTo this day, no EU legislation regarding the regulation of virtual currencies has been produced. However, it is possible to say that the EU is in a studying phase. In 2008, the ECB issued a report on virtual currency schemes<a href=\"#_ftn9\" name=\"_ftnref9\">[9]</a>, in which it defined the different schemes in which virtual currencies nowadays operate. Furthermore, the report discussed the relevance of virtual currencies to central banks and identified the main areas in which virtual currencies could be risky (e.g. price stability, financial stability and payment system stability.) Later on, the EBA published an official opinion on virtual currencies. In this report, the EBA discussed the main benefits of virtual currencies, and identified certain risks prospective must be wary of. Moreover, the EBA suggested a potential regulatory approach both for the short term and the long term. For the short term, the EBA recommends national supervisory authorities to discourage credit institutions, payment institutions and e-money institutions from buying, holding or selling virtual currencies until a comprehensive regulatory regime is developed, thus ‘shielding’ regulated financial services from virtual currencies. The long term measures include the creation of scheme governance authorities, transparent price formation, separation of client accounts, evidence of IT secure systems, payment guarantee and refunds etc. The EC has already indicated that virtual currencies will be considered for possible inclusion in the Anti-Money Laundering Directive<a href=\"#_ftn10\" name=\"_ftnref10\">[10]</a>. This proposal is currently being discussed at the level of the EC, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nKeeping in mind the competitiveness of the European market in the global aspect, it is important to understand the regulations in place across the globe. However, the situation is very similar to that in Europe: there is still very little legislation dealing with virtual currencies. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which is part of the United States Department of the Treasury, recently published an official guidance where it defined different aspects of virtual currencies<a href=\"#_ftn11\" name=\"_ftnref11\">[11]</a>. When it comes to taxation, the US treats virtual currencies in the same way they treat properties, and not money<a href=\"#_ftn12\" name=\"_ftnref12\">[12]</a>. This practice brings about certain concerns, mostly as many experts argue that this may result in virtual currencies no longer being fungible<a href=\"#_ftn13\" name=\"_ftnref13\">[13]</a>. Another important development is the proposed BitLicence<a href=\"#_ftn14\" name=\"_ftnref14\">[14]</a> regulatory framework for virtual currency firms proposed by the New York State Department of Financial Services. This framework includes consumer protection, anti-money laundering, and cyber security rules for virtual currency businesses. The framework was written in collaboration with different stakeholders, and several drafts have been published.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCanada is also starting to implement legislation on virtual currencies. In the Budget Implementation Bill of 2014 it was stated that dealers of virtual currencies should report suspicious transactions, or those over $10.000, to a government watchdog<a href=\"#_ftn15\" name=\"_ftnref15\">[15]</a>. However this is just an initial phase of regulation, as the Senate Banking Committee has recently started studying digital currencies before attempting to craft comprehensive legislation. An interesting case is Ecuador, where the government decided to ban Bitcoin and establish its own virtual currency to be used alongside the US dollar, the official tender in Ecuador<a href=\"#_ftn16\" name=\"_ftnref16\">[16]</a>. Financial professionals claim that the government will use the virtual currencies to pay the bills.
