	<li><strong> Key terms</strong></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><strong>Sustainable growth – </strong>economic growth that is conscious of the environment and social aspects.</li>
	<li><strong>Donor</strong> – a body/individual which makes a contribution to a cause, generally in a purely altruistic way and with no expectation of financial return.</li>
	<li><strong>Official Development Assistance</strong> consists of grants or loans that are undertaken by the official sector with promotion of economic development and welfare in the recipient countries as the main objective.</li>
	<li><strong>Other Official Flows</strong> are transactions which do not meet the conditions for eligibility as ODA (or official aid), either because they are not primarily aimed at development, or because they have a grant element of less than 25%.</li>
	<li><strong>Tied aid – </strong>aid that requires part, or all of it to be used to purchase goods from the country which provides the aid and/or for a certain project or purpose. The vast majority of aid is tied.</li>
	<li><strong>Investor </strong>– an individual/individuals or company which provides capital with the expectation of financial return.</li>
	<li><strong>Foreign Direct Investment </strong>– making capital available from one country for carrying out economic activity in another country, with a view of exercising control e.g. business decisions</li>
	<li><strong>Portfolio Investment:</strong> In portfolio aid, the investing party does not seek to control the economic activity in the other country.</li>
	<li><strong>Capital - </strong>This is financial resources that can be used at any time, if it is unused it can grow</li>
	<li><strong>Cotonou Framework: </strong>The Cotonou Agreement offers a framework for the European Union’s (EU) cooperation relations for the economic, social and cultural development of the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP). The Cotonou Agreement places a strong emphasis on: the political dimension, development strategies and poverty reduction, economic development, most vulnerable states, economic and trade cooperation, regional cooperation and integration. The Cotonou Framework was agreed to for a period of 20 years in 2000 and is reviewed every 5 years, we are now therefore moving into the final five year period of the framework.</li>
	<li><strong>Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><strong>[1]</strong></a>: </strong>these are eight goals which were outlined and agreed to by the United Nations in September 2000; the goals should have been achieved by 2015. We are now in a review process of the achievements made towards the goals.</li>
	<li><strong>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): </strong>The proposed follow-on from the MDGs, proposed at the UN Rio Conference in 2014. The 17 currently proposed goals will be discussed at the UN summit in September and converge with the post 2015 development agenda<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Development Assistance Committee (DAC) countries</strong> - refer to developing countries and territories on Part I of the OECD DAC List of Aid Recipients for which there is a long-standing United Nations target of 0.7% of donors' gross national product.</li>
</ul>

	<li><strong> Relevance and explanation of the issue</strong></li>
</ol>

<em>“Sustainable development is the pathway to the future we want for all. It offers a framework to generate economic growth, achieve social justice, exercise environmental stewardship and strengthen governance –<strong> Ban Ki Moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations </strong></em>

&nbsp;

By designating 2015 to the European Year of Development, the Commission broke trends in making 2015, the first year for the Commission to focus outside of the EU’s borders, taking a focus on external activities whereby the impact of the year should be seen mostly outside the EU.  This shows the willingness of the EU to focus on not only its own development but on eradicating poverty on a more global level.

&nbsp;

Despite the successes stemming from the Millennium Development Goals, there were also a number of areas where we failed to meet ambitious objectives such as the target of halving the proportion of underweight children, which was missed by 30 million children, largely because of slow progress in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. With one in four people in the developing world living on less than $1.25, it is no wonder that 83% of EU citizens believe it is essential that we continue to support the developing world in sustainable growth. When the goal of halving developing world poverty by 2010 was achieved, this proved that EU action is necessary to aid the growth of developing countries; however there must be a way to improve the EU’s huge financial contributions effectiveness.

&nbsp;

As the Millennium Goals have shown a mixed rate of achievement, 2015 is the year to outline the post 2015 framework, a new Cotonou framework and properly delve into the potentials of both donation and investment in order to achieve sustainable and lasting growth in the developing world.

&nbsp;
<ol start="3">
	<li><strong> Key questions</strong></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>Does it make sense to both donate and invest to the same developing countries?</li>
	<li>How best can the EU ensure that private funding is achieving sustainable development?</li>
	<li>How best should we move forward in light of the Millennium Development Goals and towards sustainable development goals in a broader post-2015 development agenda?</li>
	<li>Can the EU have an input into the investments made by private companies, and should they?</li>
	<li>Is the future of sustainable development in investment or donation?</li>
	<li>What focus should the post 2015 framework take in order to make more achievable yet still ambitious goals?</li>
	<li>What should the post Cotonou framework contain?</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ol start="4">
	<li><strong> Key facts and figures</strong></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>According to UNICEF, 22,000 children die each day due to poverty</li>
	<li>The poorest 40 percent of the world’s population accounts for 5 percent of global income. The richest 20 percent accounts for three-quarters of world income</li>
	<li>The special Eurobarometer report 392, published in October 2012, revealed that 85% of Europeans think it is important to help people in developing countries. This is only down by 3% since the financial and economic crises</li>
	<li>More than six out of ten Europeans think that aid to developing countries should be increased</li>
	<li>It is estimated that up to 20 million EU citizens are involved in one way or the other in the work of development NGOs, professionally or as volunteers.</li>
	<li>An estimated number of 130 million EU citizens make at least one financial donation each year to an organisation helping developing countries.</li>
	<li>The total amount which the EU reserved for external aid in 2013 was €14.86 billion, which is equal to about 9% of the overall budget of the EU. This is the equivalent of 8 cent per European per day.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></li>

	<li><strong> Key actors</strong></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<strong>The European Investment Bank<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><strong>[4]</strong></a> – </strong>Invests money in developing and cooperation countries.<strong>  </strong>

&nbsp;

<strong>European Commission<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><strong>[5]</strong></a> - </strong>Neven Mimico is the Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development; the Commission is responsible for allocating funds and setting the priorities of aid. The Commission's Directorate-General for International Cooperation and Development (DG DEVCO)<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> is responsible for designing European international cooperation and development policy and delivering aid throughout the world.

&nbsp;

<strong>Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><strong>[7]</strong></a> – </strong>promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world. It provides a platform for cohesion for governments to work together to seek solutions for common issues.

&nbsp;

<strong>CONCORD Europe<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><strong>[8]</strong></a> –</strong> brings together 45 member organisations to discuss policies for the advancement of the developing world. The members of the member organisations of CONCORD total more than 2,000 NGOs in all EU Member States.

&nbsp;

<strong>Member States</strong> <strong>–</strong> The Millennium goals indicated that Governments should donate 0.7% of their Gross National Income.  Each Member State is responsible for the amount of Gross National Income they actually contribute.

&nbsp;

<strong>Developing Countries</strong> <strong>–</strong> In many instances aid is distributed through governments in developing countries

&nbsp;

<strong>Private Companies and NGOs</strong> <strong>–</strong> Furthermore aid from the EU is donated or investment on a much larger scale by non-governmental bodies.

&nbsp;
<ol start="6">
	<li><strong> Key conflicts</strong></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

At present, the EU and its Member States contribute more than half of global relief aid to developing countries. The MDGs indicated that Member States should focus on donating 0.7% of their Gross National Income to developing countries. Whilst the MDGs focused on giving more to the developing countries, many scholars wonder if Europe should reduce its aid and instead, reinvest its time into discussing the ways of private investment, which not only provides jobs and security but also creates a long lasting future and help to achieve self-sustenance.

&nbsp;

Recent research has questioned the advantages of giving aid freely and without direct purpose (with no gain for the Donor State), versus the benefits of private investment. In the study which followed, it was found that people become more readily involved in governance issues when money is being taxed rather than when aid is cut, therefore a case can be made, that in order to restructure governance and civic engagement, it is imperative to focus on government taxation and investment instead of merely distributing aid. <a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>

&nbsp;

The UN Millennium Project Report noted the difficulties and negatives of the aid system, claiming it to be poorly targeted, frequently tied and highly unpredictable. While we understand that help is needed to increase sustainability in the growth of developing countries, how can we ensure economic, environmental and social sustainability in developing countries best? How can we reach a world where there is no poverty? At present in the EU we contribute more than half of the relief aid supplied to developing countries, with Member States and the EU supplying untied aid and private companies focusing on investment, which road leads us to a more sustainable future, where developing countries can become self-sufficient? Should there continue to be a mix of both donation and investment?

&nbsp;

When just under double that of Official Development Aid (ODA) is contributed by private investors, how can the EU ensure that funding is reaching the areas it is most needed and what direction should the EU move in to ensure that the most efficient means of development are focused on?

	<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

The <strong>objectives of the European Year of development</strong> are defined as 1) informing EU citizens about the development cooperation of the EU and its member states, 2) fostering their active interest, critical thinking and direct involvement, and 3) raising awareness of the benefits of EU development cooperation. The motto chosen for the thematic year is "Our world, our dignity, our future”. As 2015 is the Year for Development Cooperation in the EU,<strong> funding</strong> has been set aside for the likes of <strong>media campaigns and fora</strong> for individuals and Member States to come together to discuss and become proactive regarding Development

&nbsp;

The <strong>European Development Fund</strong>, created by the treaty of Rome, consists of contribution made by Member States, it runs in cycles of approximately 5 years and it places emphasis on certain parts of aid needed.

&nbsp;

The <strong>Cotonou Agreement<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><strong>[10]</strong></a></strong> offers a framework for the European Union’s (EU) cooperation relations for the economic, social and cultural development of the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP). The Cotonou Agreement places a strong emphasis on: the political dimension, development strategies and poverty reduction, economic development, most vulnerable states, economic and trade cooperation, regional cooperation and integration

&nbsp;

The United Nations summit for the adoption of the <strong>post-2015 development agenda</strong> will be held from 25 to 27 September 2015, in New York and convened as a high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly.

&nbsp;

<strong>Trading schemes</strong> - The EU has adjusted importing and exporting tariffs and taxes to allow for the growth and fairer involvement of developing countries on the market. The schemes prioritise least developed countries. <a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>

&nbsp;

<strong>The Commission ‘Communication</strong>’<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> is a policy paper which proposes 12 concrete actions in order to, for instance, improve regulatory business environments in partner countries, support business development and increase access to finance with a focus on micro, small and medium-sized businesses in the formal and informal sector, which play a particularly vital role in job creation. The document identifies areas where to catalyse private sector finance and engagement to complement European Union development assistance.

&nbsp;

Nevin Mimica, the<strong> Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development</strong> outlined<strong> three aims</strong> as he spoke about the next steps in the relationship building between the EU and developing countries including; 1. An ambitious post-2015 framework 2. Launching and negotiating a post-Cotonou Framework 3. Enhancing policy coherence to facilitate better governance.
