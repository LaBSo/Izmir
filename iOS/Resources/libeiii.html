<em>“When I was young I thought that money was the most important thing in life; now that I am old I know that it is” – <strong>Oscar Wilde</strong></em>

<strong> </strong>

Virtual currencies have become a significant way of payment and their usage has been constantly increasing in the last years. They are similar to other forms of digital money; however they differ in a few key points. First of all, virtual currencies do not have a physical counterpart with legal tender status. Another important difference lays in the fact that traditional financial institutions are not involved, as such they are not regulated by central banks like other currencies are; virtual currencies are issued by private, non-financial institutions. For these reasons, the relation between virtual currencies and traditional currencies is not regulated by law.

&nbsp;

Virtual currency schemes can be divided into three types. The first type is called “closed virtual currency scheme”. These schemes do not have a strong link to real economies, and are usually used in gaming communities. Users usually pay subscription fees, and then earn credits based on their performance. Said credits can only be used to buy goods in the game. The second type is called “virtual currency schemes with unidirectional flow”. This type of virtual currency enables users to buy virtual currencies using a traditional currency, but cannot exchange it back to the original currency. The third and last type is called “virtual currency schemes with bidirectional flows”. These kind of virtual currencies are the ones that resemble the most to our concept of usual currencies; they can be exchanged in both directions, as well as can be used to buy not only virtual goods and services, but also real ones. One example of such a currency is Bitcoin.

&nbsp;

Based on these schemes, it is understandable that virtual currencies are constantly evolving, and they start to resemble traditional currencies in many ways. Given the increased use of the internet over the years, it is imminent that they will become an important payment method in the near future. The main benefits are related to the transactions. Most virtual currencies function as peer-to-peer schemes, making transactions very similar to real, private transactions between two individuals. Using virtual currencies enable fast transactions, because no bank approval is needed when sharing a message signed with a private key to perform transaction. Since there is no intermediate third party (e.g. a bank), no transaction fees need to be paid by either of the contracting parties, thereby making the usage of virtual currencies much cheaper in comparison to other currencies. For aforementioned reasons, many people and companies are turning to these innovative methods of payment.

&nbsp;

However, the nature of virtual currencies shows a lot of vulnerability to potential threats. From the citizens’ perspective, fraud remains the main issue. Virtual currencies are used for anonymous transactions and bear the risk of loss because fraudulent exchanges. Another example of fraud related to virtual currencies can be pump-and-dump schemes<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>. Furthermore, the risk of considerable amounts of a virtual currency being removed from the market due to hacking is present. For this reason, the exchange rates for the “virtual currency schemes with bidirectional flows” can fluctuate, eventually leading to large losses for the users. Last but not least, the access to virtual currencies is guaranteed by a single so-called e-wallet; which can potentially be hacked. There is always the chance to use an e-wallet provider; however they remain private institutions and are also subject to cybercrimes. It is important to keep in mind the loss of private keys seems like an irreversible problem, since there is no possibility to access these once they are lost.

&nbsp;

On the other hand, the EU as a whole can also be damaged by actions of people who exploit the vulnerabilities of virtual currencies. Transactions using virtual currencies are anonymous, and this feature can be used in order to conduct criminal activities. Money laundry can be considered as one of the main issues; the Bitcoin protocol does not require providing identification and verification of customers. There is no central oversight body, so no Anti-Money Laundry software is currently available to monitor and identify suspicious transaction patterns. Law enforcement cannot target one central location or entity for investigative purposes. For the same reason, criminals can use virtual currencies to execute illegal payments or perform anonymous extortion. From an economic point of view, tax avoidance and the exchange rate fluctuations remain the most challenging issues. Fiscal regulations for virtual currencies are still undefined, which enables tax evasion through the use virtual currencies for purchases.

&nbsp;

These issues are not only presented from theoretical standpoint, their effects are already prevalent in reality. A striking example took place in the first months of 2012, when Bitcoin suffered a loss of 300.000 US dollars due to different hacking attacks. Furthermore, in January 2014 there was another massive cyber-attack, forcing several important online platforms to halt transactions. It is clear that the lack of regulations in the field is exploitable, and it is important to tackle the issue before virtual currencies obtain an even more prominent role in everyday life.

<ol start="3">
	<li><strong> Key questions</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
	<li>Should the EU intervene in order to regulate the use of virtual currencies, and if yes, under what legal bases?</li>
	<li>What regulations should the EU impose?</li>
	<li>How can the EU ensure that introduced regulations do not diminish the European market’s competitiveness on the global scene?</li>
	<li>If the EU does not produce regulatory legislation, what other measures can be taken with a view to minising the potential damage caused by virtual currencies?</li>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>
<ol start="4">
	<li><strong> Key facts and figures</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
	<li>There is currently no EU legislation in place regulating the use of virtual currencies.</li>
	<li>On December 2013 the European Banking Authority (EBA) issued a statement warning consumers on the risks of virtual currencies.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></li>
	<li>To this day, there are more than 500 virtual currency schemes, with a total market cap of more than 3.5 billion USD<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>.</li>
	<li>Bitcoin is the most diffused virtual currency, accounting for around 80% of the total market cap.</li>
	<li>The number of virtual currencies transactions has never exceeded 110.000 per day<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>, compared to approximately 295 million conventional payment and terminal transaction per day in Europe alone<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>.</li>
	<li>The number of internet users in the world at the end of 2000 was 361 million, while by the end of 2011 the number has increased to 2.267 million (approximately 33% of the global population)<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>.</li>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>
<ol start="5">
	<li><strong> Key actors</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

<strong>European institutions</strong>, despite currently having limited regulatory powers, are the ones, which have to ensure the safe use of the virtual currencies in the single market. Since there is no regulation in place on the EU level, the <strong>European Commission</strong> (EC) will play a vital role in proposing legislation. The regulations can be included in the current work towards the <strong>Digital Single Market</strong>. Furthermore, another important institution is the <strong>Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection of the European Parliament</strong>. Both bodies can be supported by advice coming from the <strong>European Central Bank</strong> (ECB) and the <strong>European Banking Authority (</strong>EBA). One of the tasks of the EBA, in accordance with Article 9 of its founding regulation, is to monitor new and existing financial activities and to adopt guidelines and recommendations with a view to promoting the safety and soundness of markets.

&nbsp;

<strong>National governments</strong> have a less important role in this debate, since the internal market is an exclusive competence of the EU. However, they play a more important role in shaping national legislation, on issues pertaining to the use and taxation of virtual currencies. Furthermore, it is also their duty to ensure the implementation of the EU legislation.

&nbsp;

<strong>European citizens and companies</strong>, although not directly, are important stakeholders in this debate. They do not have any regulatory power; however they are the users of the virtual currencies, which give them a crucial role. Companies and citizens should be made aware of the potential dangers of virtual currencies’ usage.

&nbsp;

<strong>Inventors, trade platforms </strong>and <strong>e-wallet<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><strong>[8]</strong></a> providers </strong>are also important and somewhat take over the banks’ roles in the field of virtual currencies. Any potential regulation imposed by the EU will be directly applied to them.

&nbsp;
<ol start="6">
	<li><strong> Key conflicts</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

It is possible to identify four main conflicts in the scope of the topic. First of all, it is important to determine whether the EU has enough <strong>legal bases </strong>to intervene in order to regulate the functioning of the virtual currencies. Although the ECB has already defined the different virtual currency schemes, it is still not clear up to which point the EU can regulate their functioning. Furthermore, it is also important to determine <strong>which institutions </strong>of the EU will be in charge of dealing with the different aspects of virtual currencies.

&nbsp;

Secondly, there are <strong>different approaches</strong> the EU can take to tackle the issue of virtual currencies. One of them can be to simply define virtual currencies as a method of payment which should abide to legislation already in place regarding issues of money laundry, taxation etc. Another approach can be to implement new legislation specifically tailored to the features of virtual currency schemes. Also, one should not forget that neither of the two “extremes” are a good way forward for the EU: taking no action and leaving the situation as it is, or completely banning the use of virtual currencies.

&nbsp;

As explained in the first section, virtual currencies can <strong>affect each citizen individually</strong>, as well as <strong>the EU in its entirety</strong>. Given the potential threats have a wide variety of effects; it would be difficult to immediately implement legislation regarding every single issue. Thus, it is key to decide which of these two aspects should be <strong>prioritized in the short term</strong>.

&nbsp;

Last but not least, European companies are constantly <strong>competing in the global market</strong>, so any regulation regarding virtual currencies can potentially affect their competitiveness too. Therefore, it is important to keep in mind the different legislation in place in other countries outside Europe. Moreover, any EU level legislation should be introduced after consultation different stakeholders.

<strong> </strong>
<ol start="7">
	<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

To this day, no EU legislation regarding the regulation of virtual currencies has been produced. However, it is possible to say that the EU is in a studying phase. In 2008, the ECB issued a report on virtual currency schemes<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>, in which it defined the different schemes in which virtual currencies nowadays operate. Furthermore, the report discussed the relevance of virtual currencies to central banks and identified the main areas in which virtual currencies could be risky (e.g. price stability, financial stability and payment system stability.) Later on, the EBA published an official opinion on virtual currencies. In this report, the EBA discussed the main benefits of virtual currencies, and identified certain risks prospective must be wary of. Moreover, the EBA suggested a potential regulatory approach both for the short term and the long term. For the short term, the EBA recommends national supervisory authorities to discourage credit institutions, payment institutions and e-money institutions from buying, holding or selling virtual currencies until a comprehensive regulatory regime is developed, thus ‘shielding’ regulated financial services from virtual currencies. The long term measures include the creation of scheme governance authorities, transparent price formation, separation of client accounts, evidence of IT secure systems, payment guarantee and refunds etc. The EC has already indicated that virtual currencies will be considered for possible inclusion in the Anti-Money Laundering Directive<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>. This proposal is currently being discussed at the level of the EC, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU.

&nbsp;

Keeping in mind the competitiveness of the European market in the global aspect, it is important to understand the regulations in place across the globe. However, the situation is very similar to that in Europe: there is still very little legislation dealing with virtual currencies. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which is part of the United States Department of the Treasury, recently published an official guidance where it defined different aspects of virtual currencies<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>. When it comes to taxation, the US treats virtual currencies in the same way they treat properties, and not money<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>. This practice brings about certain concerns, mostly as many experts argue that this may result in virtual currencies no longer being fungible<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>. Another important development is the proposed BitLicence<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a> regulatory framework for virtual currency firms proposed by the New York State Department of Financial Services. This framework includes consumer protection, anti-money laundering, and cyber security rules for virtual currency businesses. The framework was written in collaboration with different stakeholders, and several drafts have been published.

&nbsp;

Canada is also starting to implement legislation on virtual currencies. In the Budget Implementation Bill of 2014 it was stated that dealers of virtual currencies should report suspicious transactions, or those over $10.000, to a government watchdog<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>. However this is just an initial phase of regulation, as the Senate Banking Committee has recently started studying digital currencies before attempting to craft comprehensive legislation. An interesting case is Ecuador, where the government decided to ban Bitcoin and establish its own virtual currency to be used alongside the US dollar, the official tender in Ecuador<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>. Financial professionals claim that the government will use the virtual currencies to pay the bills. A monetary authority will be established to regulate the money.
