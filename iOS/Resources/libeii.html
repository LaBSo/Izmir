<ul>
	<li><strong>Freedom of speech – </strong>Also referred to as freedom of opinion and expression. Freedom of speech is covered in Article 19 in United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a>, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), Article 11 in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a> (EU) and Article 10 in the European Convention on Human Rights<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a> (ECHR<strong>)</strong>. Although the phrasing of clauses in question do vary, they all cover the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the right to hold opinions and receive information without interference and regardless of frontiers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Freedom of thought, conscience and religion </strong>– Covered in Article 18 in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></a>, Article 10 in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><sup><sup>[5]</sup></sup></a> and Article 9 in the ECHR<sup> <a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></sup>. Everyone is entitled to change their religion or belief, and practise one’s religion in public or private.</li>
	<li><strong>Hate speech </strong>– Hate speech covers all forms of expression which spread, incite, promote or justify racial hatred, xenophobia, anti-Semitism or other forms of hatred based on intolerance, including: intolerance expressed by aggressive nationalism and ethnocentrism, discrimination and hostility against minorities, migrants and people of immigrant origin.<sup> <a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></sup></li>

<em>“What protects people’s rights to say things I find objectionable is precisely what protects my right to object.” – <strong>Jodie Ginsberg, CEO of Index on Censorship </strong></em>

<strong> </strong>

On the 7th of January 2015, two gunmen walked into the offices of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris and shot 12 people.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><sup><sup>[8]</sup></sup></a> Just hours after the attack, millions of people took to social media to express their condolences and support for freedom of expression and freedom of speech through the hashtag #jesuischarlie (I am Charlie), making it one of the most used hashtags in Twitter’s history.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><sup><sup>[9]</sup></sup></a> In addition to online activity, millions also marched for free speech all over Europe.

&nbsp;

On the 14th of February 2015, one person was killed and three police officers were injured after an armed attack on a cafe in Copenhagen where a debate on Islam and free speech was being held. Present at the meeting was Lars Vilks, a controversial Swedish artist who has faced death threats for caricaturing the prophet Muhammad.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><sup><sup>[10]</sup></sup></a> The incidents in Copenhagen and Paris lack connection and were executed by different perpetrators, but share a clear discontent and extremist view on published content about Islam in European media. The attacks further sparked the ongoing debate on freedom of speech and expression in Europe.

&nbsp;

Security measures were increased in many Jewish communities with police protection of schools, synagogues and working places. In several Member States, mosques began to receive police protection. In the United Kingdom, eight Muslim-owned businesses were attacked with hammers and guns in Birmingham between the 10th and 12th of January 2015. Further examples of Islamophobia following the attacks in Paris included a bomb threat at the main mosque in Gothenburg, Sweden, vandalism against Muslim property and Muslim women in Denmark reporting headscarves being torn off.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><sup><sup>[11]</sup></sup></a>

&nbsp;

In anti-Semitic incidents the main perpetrators are sympathisers of the far right and far left, neo-nazis, Muslim fundamentalists and young people. Some motives to these and other religiously fuelled attacks are failed integration and social exclusion leading to intolerance and xenophobia in many Member States.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><sup><sup>[12]</sup></sup></a>

&nbsp;

While attacks such as the ones in Paris and Copenhagen have increased, other extremist sentiments have also elevated. Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West (PEGIDA) is a German anti-Islam political organisation founded in Dresden in October 2014. PEGIDA organised weekly demonstrations during autumn 2014 against the Islamisation of Europe call for more restrictive immigration rules.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><sup><sup>[13]</sup></sup></a> Supporters of PEGIDA say European citizens need to wake up and realise the threat from Islamist extremists and want a curbed immigration, accusing German authorities of failing to enforce the laws. PEGIDA and similar anti-immigration movements attract a vast variety of right-wing groups, but also ordinary citizens worrying about conservative Islam and its impact on society and culture. Many fear that further immigration is posing a threat to preservation of European culture and values.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><sup><sup>[14]</sup></sup></a>

&nbsp;

Right-wing movements have seen an increased momentum in the past few years with several right-wing parties being elected at the European, National and Regional level. In the European Parliament elections in 2014, right-wing parties such as the National Front (France) and UKIP (United Kingdom) saw an all-time high in popularity<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"><sup><sup>[15]</sup></sup></a><a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"><sup><sup>[16]</sup></sup></a>. This manifests a rise in anti-immigration sentiments and xenophobia in the EU. Right-wing extremism is interesting to this topic because it showcases a lack of tolerance towards other cultures in Member States. At the same time, free and democratic societies allow sentiments of said nature to also flourish, within set parameters and laws.

&nbsp;

In fact, what individuals are and are not allowed to say varies in different countries with different hate speech and defamation laws in Member States. The question of harmonising free speech legislation is brought up especially with regards to internet safety and publications online as an increasing amount of communication takes place over the internet.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"><sup><sup>[17]</sup></sup></a>

<ol start="3">
	<li><strong> Key questions</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
	<li>Should there be limitations to freedom of speech and religion? If yes, what limitations?</li>
	<li>What is the right ethical middle path in terms of granting everyone civil liberties such as freedom of expression and freedom of religion?</li>
	<li>Where is the border between being insulting and being critical in the press?</li>
	<li>How do we ensure that far-right extremism doesn’t become a problem for people targeted by these movements?</li>
	<li>Where do extremist sentiments and movements come from?</li>
	<li>How can legislation on civil liberties such as freedom of expression be harmonised on the Member State level?</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ol start="4">
	<li><strong> Key facts and figures</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
	<li>The French Council of the Muslim Faith recorded a 110 % increase in reported cases of Islamophobia between January 2014 and January 2015.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18"><sup><sup>[18]</sup></sup></a></li>
	<li>374 anti-Semitic hate crimes were reported in Germany in 2012, 221 anti-Semitic hate crimes in Sweden and 307 in United Kingdom and 4 in Ireland. <a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"><sup><sup>[19]</sup></sup></a></li>
	<li>Jewish people wearing visible symbols of their religion are the most likely to be the targets of anti-Semitic incidents.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20"><sup><sup>[20]</sup></sup></a></li>
	<li>The top 50 countries in the Press Freedom Index include 31 European ones.</li>
	<li>Despite the EU Member States’ high scoring in the Press Freedom Index, developments have sullied the performance of some countries with regard to protection of freedom of information. United Kingdom and France are two striking examples to this.</li>
	<li>In 2014, 47 violations to the European Convention on Human Rights regarding freedom of expression were reported in France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Italy, Switzerland, Slovenia and Turkey. 24 of these were reported in Turkey.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21"><sup><sup>[21]</sup></sup></a></li>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>
<ol start="5">
	<li><strong> Key actors</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

<strong>European institutions</strong> - Although the EU has limited competences with regards to civil liberties, much of it is constituted in the the <strong>Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU</strong> and the <strong>ECHR. The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) </strong>is an international court set up in 1959 ruling on State or Individual applications alleging violations of civil and political rights set out in the ECHR. The ECtHR monitors respect for the human rights of 800 million Europeans in 47 <strong>Council of Europe</strong> Member States that have ratified the Convention.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22"><sup><sup>[22]</sup></sup></a>

&nbsp;

<strong>National governments</strong> – Civil liberties such as freedom of expression and of thought, conscience and religion is regulated in national constitution and penal/criminal code. There is no fixed practice across Member States but adherence to international charters and conventions is common.

&nbsp;

<strong>Right-wing movements - </strong>Right-wing organisations with political purpose and political parties elected into European and National institutions are main drivers in targeting hate towards religious and social groups. There is a disagreement over what unites the extreme-right (or radical-right) parties, but anti-immigrant sentiment is the most common ideological theme. Racism, ethnocentrism, anti-immigration and welfare chauvinism are the policies that most characterize relatively successful extreme-right parties.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23"><sup><sup>[23]</sup></sup></a>

&nbsp;

<strong>Citizens, religion practitioners, NGOs and social groups (such as immigrants) - </strong>The receivers and users of civil liberties.

<strong>The Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA)</strong> - one of the EU’s decentralised agencies providing expert advice to the institutions of the EU and the Member States. The FRA helps to ensure that the fundamental rights of people living in the EU are protected.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24"><sup><sup>[24]</sup></sup></a>

<strong> </strong>
<ol start="6">
	<li><strong> Key conflicts</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

There can be confusion between freedom of expression and respect for non-discrimination and the diversity of religious and non-religious beliefs. Freedom of expression includes the right to be critical and disparaging of religions or religious practices. However, international instruments draw a clear line on this dichotomy, prohibiting any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence.<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a>

&nbsp;

How can civil liberties be adapted to European citizens; to find a balance where everyone has the freedom to express themselves, while at the same time not feeling attacked by these same rights. Are certain limitations necessary to achieve this? If so, what should these limitations be? Certain limitations already exist (see ‘Measures already in place’ below), such as ban on insulting a state, flag or president. Because of this there is technically no limitless freedom of speech in the EU as all Member States have variations to international conventions and charters in their national legislation.

&nbsp;

Similarly, one needs to consider the reasons for sentiments leading to certain opinions and explore why and how such extremist movements emerge and grow. In Germany, two attempts have been made to ban the neonazi-party NPD with the German Constitutional Court.<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26"><sup><sup>[26]</sup></sup></a>  How efficient are limitations and bans in addressing these issues? While a ban of such a political party would lead to a less sophisticated organisation, the people with supporting sentiments will still remain. In other words, the idea itself that is at the core of the issue is not tackled. What are the happenings in society that favour the development of these sentiments?

&nbsp;

Some research point to that anti-immigration sentiments are rooted in intolerance and competition for scarce resources as a result of economic deprivation. One issue with this idea is that anti-immigration sentiment is found in all social classes.<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27"><sup><sup>[27]</sup></sup></a> Other research point to that people who oppose immigration seem to fear that the newcomers will change the group’s identity and fail to contribute to the country as a whole. Policymakers could look into ways of showing native-born people that immigrants are not very different, and therefore not a threat to cultural identity, rather than focusing on monetary incentives and jobs.<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28"><sup><sup>[28]</sup></sup></a> Social scientists describe xenophobia as one of many reactions generated by anomic situations in modern societies. However, xenophobic or racist reactions are not necessarily aggravated by the presence of a large number of immigrants. There are examples showing that social decline of specific groups and right-wing political organisations are sufficient preconditions for the emergence of xenophobia.<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29"><sup><sup>[29]</sup></sup></a>

&nbsp;

Much of the intolerance is rooted in lack of understanding. The EU is a pluralistic area in terms of religion but the main religion in most Member States is Christianity.<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30"><sup><sup>[30]</sup></sup></a> Education and integration play crucial roles in ensuring a better understanding of different cultures and religions. How can education be developed to bridge this gap in understanding?

	<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

Freedom of speech is covered in Article 19 in UDHR<sup> <a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31"><sup>[31]</sup></a></sup>, Article 11 in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32"><sup><sup>[32]</sup></sup></a> and Chapter 10 in the ECHR<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33"><sup><sup>[33]</sup></sup></a>. Freedom of thought, conscience and religion is covered in Article 18 in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34"><sup><sup>[34]</sup></sup></a>, Article 10 in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35"><sup><sup>[35]</sup></sup></a> and Article 9 in the ECHR<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36"><sup><sup>[36]</sup></sup></a>. Where questions concerning the relationship between State and religions are at stake, the role of the national decision-making body is given special importance.<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37"><sup><sup>[37]</sup></sup></a>

&nbsp;

As a resolution of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly rather than a treaty the UDHR is not legally binding in its entirety on members of the UN. Freedom of speech is granted explicit protection in international law by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which is binding in 150 nations<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38"><sup><sup>[38]</sup></sup></a>. All Member States in the EU are signatories of the ECHR in addition to having constitutional and legal rights to freedom of expression on the national level.

&nbsp;

<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No hate speech movement</span></em>

No hate speech movement is a project by the Council of Europe for human rights online and against the expression of hate speech in all forms. It is based on human rights education, youth participation and media literacy and aims at reducing hate speech and combating discrimination and racism online and offline. It aims to achieve this by raising awareness through creative solution by equipping youth organisations and young people with knowledge and competences to recognise and act against human rights violations.<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39"><sup><sup>[39]</sup></sup></a>

&nbsp;

<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">United Nations </span></em>

On the day of its fiftieth anniversary, in 1995, UN’s Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization’s Member States adopted a Declaration of Principles on Tolerance. Education for tolerance should aim at countering influences that lead to fear and exclusion of others and help young people develop capacities for independent judgement, critical thinking and ethical reasoning. The UNESCO suggests 5 steps to achieve more tolerance between people of different religions, cultures and ethnicities. These are through law, education, access to information individual awareness and local solutions.<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40"><sup><sup>[40]</sup></sup></a>

&nbsp;

<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI)</span></em>

ECRI is a body of the Council of Europe entrusted with the task of combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, anti-semitism and intolerance in Europe from the perspective of the protection of human rights, in the light of the ECHR, its additional protocols and related case-law. It pursues the objectives to review Member States’ legislation, policies and other measures to combat racism, xenophobia, anti-semitism and intolerance, and their effectiveness, propose further action at local, national and European level, to formulate general policy recommendations to Member States and to study international legal instruments applicable in the matter with a view to their reinforcement where appropriate.
