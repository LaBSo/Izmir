<ul>
	<li><strong>Freedom of movement </strong>– Is a fundamental principal of the EU, which confers the European citizens’ the right to reside, work, and look for a job in all Members States. The right to free movement is restricted to EU nationals who use it for work purposes.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></li>
	<li><strong>Social Security – </strong>The practice of providing economic security and social welfare for individuals through government programs financed from compulsory public taxation.</li>
	<li><strong>Internal migrations </strong>– All the migrations fluxes that occur within the EU Member States. This differs from external migration, which is migration to or from outside the EU.</li>
	<li><strong>Social security fraud</strong> – Any act or omission aiming to obtain or receive social security benefits or aiming to avoid obligations to pay social security contributions, contrary to the law of a Member State.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></li>

<strong> </strong>

<em>"Free movement of workers has always been one of the key pillars of the internal market, which I will defend, while accepting the right of national authorities to fight abuse of fraudulent claims.” – <strong>Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission</strong></em>

<strong> </strong>

Freedom of movement is one of the four fundamental principles of the EU. As the most celebrated achievement of the Union amongst Europeans, it provides the right to work and reside in any country of the EU and the European Economic Area, as well as Switzerland<strong>. </strong>Nonetheless, while the European Commission is taking action to further enforce freedom of movement within Member States, certain national governments are posing significant threats to the practicalities of its implementation, stressing on its negative effects on a national level. Therefore, the debate on curtailing freedom of movement will be at the heart of the policy agenda of the Juncker Commission, which started its work last November.

&nbsp;

Free movement of persons and workers, as established in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>, sets the basis for the European citizenship and for the European common labour market. In fact, as part of the free movement principle, citizens are entitled to:
<ul>
	<li>look for a job in another EU country;</li>
	<li>work there without needing a work permit;</li>
	<li>reside in another country whilst seeking work;</li>
	<li>stay in that country even after employment there has come to an end;</li>
	<li>enjoy equal treatment with nationals with regard to access to employment, working conditions and all other social and tax advantages.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

This is only possible through the compromise of all Member States, who follow the European legislation in order to include European citizens in their respective welfare systems through common administrative procedures. In this sense, each Member State remains free to scheme its social security system independently, while being integrated in the European legislation.

&nbsp;

Some of the academic literature noted three distinct phases of free movement.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> Prior to the 2004 and 2007 enlargements, most movements were small scale and regional, for example, between Member States with close historical links. Following the 2004 enlargement, the second phase of EU migration saw very large numbers of, in many cases unanticipated, movements from east to west; and the third phase has seen an initial decline in east-west migration following the economic crisis, with some evidence of a new south-north trend in movement of workers from the crisis hit Member States of the south to the more prosperous north.

&nbsp;

Criticism has been raised regarding the effects of free movement of persons and workers on national welfare systems, labour markets and social integration in several Member States. Accordingly, EU immigrants are seen as a threat to social security systems, as said systems can get overloaded by an increasing number of users, with negative repercussions on the national citizens’ coverage. Also, internal migration fluxes have relevant effects on national labour markets, pressure on wage levels, and job-related benefits.

&nbsp;

In the context of high unemployment rates and an enlarged European common area, the EU has to produce a response to aforementioned critical positions and find ways to mitigate the negative consequences of freedom of movement, whilst granting this fundamental right to all European citizens.

	<li><strong> Key questions</strong></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>Is it possible for Member States to limit access to social security without a ground on nationality-based discrimination?</li>
	<li>What possible restrictions can a government put upon its own welfare system?</li>
	<li>What are the legal limits for reforming freedom of movement and its consequences for European citizens?</li>
	<li>Could further social integration reduce citizens’ negative opinions on the immigration’s impact on social security systems?</li>
	<li>What should the European Commission’s next steps be towards protecting freedom of movement while accommodating critical demands raised by Member States?</li>
	<li>What is the role of European citizens in this debate?</li>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>
<ol start="4">
	<li><strong> Key facts and figures</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
	<li>56% of the Union citizens consider free movement of people, goods and services to be the most positive result of the EU.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></li>
	<li>At the end of 2012, 14.1 million EU citizens were residing in another Member State for less than one year (2.8% of the total population).<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></li>
	<li>Non-active EU mobile citizens represent a very small share of the total population in each Member State and between 0.7% and 1.0% of the overall EU population.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></li>
	<li>For the EU as a whole, the GDP effect of recent intra-EU mobility flows is equivalent to a collective income gain of around 24 billion EUR for EU citizens.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></li>
	<li>One in four (27%) citizens residing in another EU country report problems and almost one in two (47%) say that staff in local administrations do not have sufficient information about their EU rights.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ol start="5">
	<li><strong> Key actors</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
	<li>The <strong>European Commission</strong> sees effective freedom of movement as a key solution to some of the current shortcomings of the European internal market. The Commission fosters mobility within Member States and defends that flux migrations have low impact on national social security systems.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> Freedom of movement is in the agenda of the Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion and the Directore-General for Justice and Consumers.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>The <strong>European Council</strong> has also stated favourable opinions towards further enforcement of free movement of workers, as concluded in the meeting held in Brussels on the 26<sup>th</sup> and 27<sup>th</sup> of June 2014.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> The Council sets guidelines for the application of relevant principles in the Justice and Home affairs configuration, as well as in the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Protection configuration.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>The <strong>European Parliament</strong> has presented, together with the European Council, a directive for the  guarantee of <em>equal treatment</em> <em>of Union workers and members of their family without discrimination on grounds of nationality</em>, through the designation of national bodies responsible for the appropriate application of free movement EU legislation.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>EU institutions count on several research groups and consultative bodies that produce useful studies and data for the debate on curtailing freedom of movement. For instance, the <strong>European Economic and Social Committee</strong><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><sup><sup>[14]</sup></sup></a>, the <strong>Free movement of workers and Social security coordination</strong> (FreSsco)<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a> and the <strong>Eurofound</strong><a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a> are important data generators when it comes to EU policy creation.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><strong>Member States</strong> defend their national interests; despite being present at the European Council, each Member State voices its own opinion on how freedom of movement should be implemented. In this sense, critical Member States try to introduce their concerns in the Council’s agenda. The joint letter between Germany, the UK, Austria and The Netherlands is a good example of such functioning.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

The <strong>United Kingdom </strong>is the Member State arguing most strongly in favour of curtailing freedom of movement. Indeed, David Cameron has sent an ultimatum threatening to leave the EU if reforms restraining free movement do not take place, and has proposed three key actions in order to reduce the European immigration to the UK.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a> Nonetheless, many see those severe declarations as an intent of the Conservatives to gain electorate from the far right party UKIP, whose speech against immigration is increasingly attracting voters during the run up to the May 2015 general elections.

&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><strong>Civil society</strong>, conformed by citizens and private organisations, is also to be taken into consideration, as it plays a crucial role in defining governments’ agendas. In fact, <strong>public opinion</strong> and electorate interests are likely to define governments’ guidelines; while the so-called <strong>opinion generators</strong>, like the media or social studies companies, present arguments in favour of or against certain opinions, impregnating the discussion on freedom of movement.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ol start="6">
	<li><strong> Key conflicts</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

As discussed above, one could argue governments declaring interest in curtailing freedom of movement may be doing so, primarily for gaining electoral support ahead of national elections. If this is to be the case, free movement is being held hostage to politics for election-winning purposes. Nonetheless, problems related to immigration are some of the more serious concerns of many Europeans<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>, hence, there seems to be evidence of genuine concern of European citizens in certain Member States.

&nbsp;

On another note, Member States express worries over possible “social dumping”, the potential abuse of welfare systems and the financial burden that inactive migrants may put on welfare systems in the receiving countries. The European Commission, however, is less prone to raise awareness on those fears, finding evidence that they have small effects on national welfare systems and labour markets. Despite the limitations to free residence already included in the treaties, national welfares demand more protection against such dangers in order to assure effective, yet possible freedom of movement.

&nbsp;

Restricting freedom of movement, however, is not a simple endeavour. Indeed, it would require either a treaty amendment, with the subsequent unanimity requirement; or a set of directives from the Commission. For this reason, the Commission remains specially careful on the possibility that such limitations do not take place on the basis of nation-based discrimination, promoting social inclusion for migrants both within civil society and public administration decisions.

&nbsp;

Additionally, the Commission is concerned with the lack of correct implementation of free movement on national, regional and local levels, and understands this lack of accurate application to be a core problem for the achievement of effective freedom of movement. The lack of correct understanding and insufficient evaluation of public policies are on the cornerstone of controversies. In this sense, discussions do not remain on the principle itself as they do in the way it is put into practice by national governments.

&nbsp;
<ol start="7">
	<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

The overall strategy of the EU consists of fostering workers’ internal mobility, while ensuring correct application of the European legislation on freedom of movement in order to reduce both potential social security fraud and unjustified limitations of the principle. Hence, concrete measures have been already implemented in the fields of social security and labour market.

Firstly, EU legislation limits free movement of citizens’ from recently adherent Member States. Indeed, the Stockholm Programme set transitional measures from 2010 to 2014 aiming to limit the impact of Bulgaria and Romania adhesions on the common European area, through transitional integration measures applied on citizens from both countries who migrated to work and live abroad. Building on the achievements of the programme, the same strategy is currently being applied for the transitional integration of Croatia, who became the 28th Member State on July 2013.

&nbsp;

Moreover, through social security coordination, the Barroso Commission presented the European Citizenship Report 2013, studying the possibility to extend the export period of unemployment benefits from the current 3 months to a minimum of 6 months. It also settled the framework to ensure that local administrations are given the tools to fully comprehend the free movement rights of EU citizens.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>

&nbsp;

In addition to those measures, the European Commission took action to further improve the application of free movement through the publication of the Guide on Habitual Residence Test, a tool for Member States to acknowledge who is responsible for the provision of social security benefits in particular cases, helping governments prevent abuses from social welfare systems. Furthermore, the European Social Fund dedicates 20% of its national expense provisions on social inclusion for disadvantaged collectives, such as internal immigrants.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>

&nbsp;

The second set of measures are aimed at homogenising national labour market conditions in order to limit migration impacts. In addition to open-method coordination between Member States and EU institutions, the European Commission monitors the European employment strategy for EU countries to share information, discuss and coordinate their employment policies. Although this strategy contains numerous measures to reduce unemployment, it is still highly relevant for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs I, as it provides Member States with the chance to improve inclusion of European migrants in their labour markets. This strategy analyses the development of the European labour market through the annual publication of a joint employment report, as well as provides country-specific recommendations issued by the Commission.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>

&nbsp;

Likewise, the Commission, in co-operation with the Public Employment Services of the EEA Member States (and Switzerland) manage the European Employment Services (EURES), the biggest job mobility portal for EU workers. Around 150.000 jobseekers per year get a job or job offer via EURES, according to official data.

&nbsp;

Finally, the Junker Commission has already defined the creation of a new directive on facilitating the exercise of rights in the context of free movement of workers, to be in implemented on May 2016. The directive aims, among others, to assure national bodies are ready and in place, able to provide better information on the right of free movement, as well as more general support and assistance to Union workers and their families. <a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>
