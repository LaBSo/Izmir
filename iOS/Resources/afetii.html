</ol>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><strong>The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)</strong> - the main insurgent group, sometimes referred to as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria or ISIS, is the latest incarnation of a Sunni extremist movement with the aim of establishing a caliphate - a single, transnational Islamic state based on sharia organized by Jordanian-born Abu Musab al-Zarqawi after the U.S.-led invasion of 2003, and currently ruled by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi known by his supporters as Caliph Ibrahim.</li>
	<li><strong>Sharia or Islamic law</strong> influences the legal code in most Muslim countries. A movement to allow sharia to govern personal status law, a set of regulations that pertain to marriage, divorce, inheritance, and custody, is even expanding into the West.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></li>
	<li><strong>Jihadists</strong> adhere to an extreme interpretation of Sunni Islam and consider themselves the only true believers. In the particular case of ISIL, they hold that the rest of the world is made up of unbelievers who seek to destroy Islam, justifying attacks against other Muslims and non-Muslims alike.</li>
	<li><strong>The Sunni Muslims</strong> can mostly be interpreted as the orthodox and traditionalist branch of Islam. The tradition in this case refers to practices based on precedent or reports of the actions of the Prophet Muhammad and those close to him.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></li>
	<li><strong>The Shia Muslims</strong> believe that following the Prophet Muhammad's death, leadership should have passed directly to his cousin/son-in-law, Ali bin Abu Talib. Throughout history, Shia Muslims have not recognized the authority of elected Muslim leaders, choosing instead to follow a line of Imams which they believe have been appointed by the Prophet Muhammad or God Himself.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ol start="2">
	<li><strong> Relevance and explanation of the issue</strong></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has dramatically undermined stability in Iraq, Syria and the broader Middle East and poses a threat to international peace and security. ISIL continues to commit gross, systematic abuses of human rights and violations of international law including indiscriminate killing and deliberate targeting of civilians, mass executions and extrajudicial killings, persecution of individuals and entire communities on the basis of their identity, kidnapping of civilians, forced displacement of Shia communities and minority groups, killing and maiming of children, rape and other forms of sexual violence, along with numerous other atrocities. <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>

The Islamic State’s current military strategy—including its funding, equipment, manpower, and operational capabilities—is much more sophisticated than anything the West has witnessed from similar groups.
The militants control huge passages of land, including oil wells, and have large quantities of military hardware and significant financial resources from oil exports, smuggling, extortion, black marketeering and legitimate businesses at its disposal. The ISIL has deepened its roots and undertaken a massive recruitment on religious ideology not only from Iraq and Syria but also from other parts of the globe. Some return to commit terrorist acts in their countries of origin. France and Belgium have suffered horrendous killings perpetrated by returnee jihadists.

&nbsp;

The militants conduct a massive “marketing” campaign that uses all modern means of communication and focuses mainly on Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. With this campaign, the Islamic State pursues three parallel objectives: to threaten and terrorize Western audiences; to disseminate propaganda for recruitment purposes; and to intimidate the populations of territories the group wants to conquer.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>

&nbsp;

The main power that ISIL has is that it controls a very large territory, through its ideological supporters and armed fighters. The map below shows the territory division in Iraq and Syria, as well as the areas ISIL had either attacked, controlled or held power over as of January 15<sup>th</sup>.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Think tanks, diplomatic missions and media are widespread with analyses of the ISIL. Recently, some progress has been made in the fight against ISIL, with Kurdish forces making headway and Global Coalition to counter ISIL inflicting the airstrikes in northern Iraq as well as in Syria. After Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh was burned to death while been trapped in a cage, Jordan’s interior minister, Hussein al-Majali said security services have a tight grip and are ready to intensify strikes and that this is “the beginning of a continued process to eliminate ISIL and wipe them out completely“.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>

&nbsp;

France, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Estonia, Hungary, Belgium and Denmark are Member States that actively take part in countering terrorism in Iraq and Syria through participation in the military provision of the Global Coalition. Sweden, Austria, Switzerland, Ireland, Spain, Slovakia, Norway and Luxemburg, on the other hand, provide humanitarian aid to help those affected by the clashes. <a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>

&nbsp;

The EU Civil Protection Mechanism has been activated to support “rapid deployment of in-kind assistance and expertise to Iraq.” The European Commission has increased the level of aid to $22 million in 2014. The EU is determined to stand by Iraq in the fight against terrorism The European Union remains committed to contributing to regional and international efforts to fight ISIL and other terrorist groups that threaten regional and global stability. The European Commission wants to invest another €1 billion of aid in Iraq and Syria over the next two years as part of a broader effort to counter ISIL. Much of the new money will go to humanitarian aid that is mostly directed at international and European NGOs working inside Syria and Iraq, and the related refugee crisis.

&nbsp;

EU High Representative Federica Mogherini attended the first ministerial level meeting of the Global Coalition to counter ISIL, which was held at the invitation of U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in Brussels on 3 December 2014.

&nbsp;

The EU has been actively engaging Qatari and Saudi Arabia authorities on the fight against terrorism, and positively notes both countries' engagement in the international coalition against ISIL. In this context, preventing the direct or indirect financing of terrorist groups by individuals and charities from Gulf countries has been a key concern for the EU.

&nbsp;

Furthermore, there is no question that Global Coalition should do what it can to minimize civilian casualties, but they are fighting an asymmetric war against a movement that does not wear uniforms, may or may not mark its vehicles, and can draw on decades of experience in regional conflicts where irregular forces have used civilians as human shields.

&nbsp;

To cope with those aspects of the situation that are pressing and relevant to Europe, Global Coalition and EU leaders must focus their efforts on five key areas: counterterrorism cooperation, the interruption of financial flows to ISIL, humanitarian assistance, political dialogue, and long-term policy reforms.

&nbsp;
<ol start="3">
	<li><strong> Key questions</strong></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>In light of the establishment of Global Coalition to tackle the ISIL threat, how and to what extent should partaking countries utilize military action as a means to overcome radical islamism and other extremist ideologies?</li>
	<li>In addition to existing measures stemming from security concerns, can and should do the EU still aspire to develop a political response, with a view to assisting the establishment of a free and open society in Syria and Iraq?</li>
	<li>What steps must be taken to build up  on the common EU strategy to counter ISIL, in terms of existing Common Security and Defense Policy the EU Counter Terrorism Strategy?</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ol start="4">
	<li><strong> Key facts and figures</strong></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>ISIL is estimated to have between 20,000 and 31,000 fighters, well known for their brutality.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></li>
	<li>ISIL raises approximately $2 million a day from oil sales, taxes extortion and smuggling; the entirety of its funds are estimated to be around $2 billion.<sup> <a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></sup></li>
	<li>ISIL and its allies control about 40,000 sq km of Iraq and Syria - roughly the size of Belgium; however, including Mosul, Tikrit, Falluja and Tal Afar in Iraq; Raqqa in Syria - oil fields, dams, main roads and border crossings the overall territory under ISIL control is closer to 90,000 sq km.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></li>
	<li>The Soufan Group recently estimated that more than 12,000 foreign nationals from at least 81 countries are fighting among ISIL ranks. Furthermore, more than 3,000 Europeans have joined militant Islamists fighting in Syria and Iraq according to EU statistics. Thirty percent of the recruits have since returned to Europe.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></li>
	<li>Through over 2,000 air strikes, the U.S.-led Global Coalition has managed to force ISIL out of some 700 sq km of territory that was previously under ISIL control. Hundreds of vehicles and tanks have been destroyed, as well as nearly 200 oil and gas facilities used by ISIL to fund its operations, and more than 1,000 military sites.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></li>
	<li>There are 3.3 million displaced people in Iraq, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), and <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/54c5244d6.html">1 million </a>of them were uprooted in 2014 alone. In Syria, more than <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/54c5244d6.html">3.8 million</a>people have fled to neighboring countries, such as Lebanon and Turkey, and another 7.6 million are displaced within the country's borders.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ol start="5">
	<li><strong> Key actors</strong></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<strong>Iraq and Syria</strong> are the two main countries in which <strong>the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant </strong>presence is most prevalent. ISIL also has ambitions pertaining to the remaining parts of Iraq and Syria that are not currently under its control.

&nbsp;

<strong>The Persian Gulf countries</strong>, such as the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait and Jordan are naturally directly affected by ISIL activity in the region because of their geographical proximity. So far, they have created task forces to tackle the ISIL threat, as well as conducted missions and airstrikes to protect their borders and help stop ISIL from expanding.

&nbsp;

<strong>The United States of America </strong>as the leader of the Global Anti-ISIL Coalition<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>, has acted on the invitation of Iraqi government as the main actor on the field in terms of military supply and military support, assessment of Iraqi forces and the threat ISIL poses. For decades, the United States has pursued a set of core interests in the region: countering terrorism and stopping the spread of nuclear weapons, securing the free flow of commerce and safeguarding the security of the region. On November 7th, 2014 President Obama asked Congress for an additional $5.6 billion to fight ISIL and authorized 1,500 more troops to be deployed in non-combat roles against ISIL in Iraq, bringing the total number above 3,000. <a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>

&nbsp;

<strong>The European Union</strong> has committed more than $200 million in humanitarian assistance to Iraq and Syria and  is managing aid from the <strong>Member States, </strong>who have divided into military provision, aid support and general support to defeat ISIL. <a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>

<strong> </strong>
<ol start="6">
	<li><strong> Key conflicts</strong></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

The first conflict can be classified as an internal one, where Sunni Muslim members of ISIL are fighting against the government of Iraq, and their Shia supporters. Also fighting back against the Islamic State are the Kurds<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>, who are defending and even expanding their grip on parts of the north against the resurgent Sunni-led extremists. The revival of such sectarian-based groups, some with close ties to Iran, sharpens the cultural fault lines that have long prevented Iraq from developing an inclusive government demanded by the United States and its international partners, though the problem now spills past the Iraqi border.

&nbsp;

The second issue is that ISIL is presenting as a direct threat to bordering countries with its clear message of expansion around the Middle East. Cooperation between these countries would benefit their shared interests in defeating ISIL and strengthening their borders, but has not been particularly durable, and they continue to act individually.

&nbsp;

A long-standing concern in the region, particularly for America, has been energy security. Now, ensuring supply and guaranteeing that Persian Gulf oil doesn’t fall into unfriendly hands — or stop flowing entirely — is a core interest for as long as America and the world are dependent on hydrocarbons.

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, the strategy of the Global Coalition is more a rough draft than the planned and thoroughly thought through tactics which the world demands. There has not been a single strategic decision on how to bring stability to the regions where ISIL been defeated, and little is known about the support of the rebels by local civilians living in the occupied areas.

&nbsp;

More unfortunately, the EU, as one of the biggest world actors, has not been responsive to the threat posed by ISIL. As a champion of democracy and human rights, the EU should help Iraq and Syria in building a democratic society, and indeed, on February 6<sup>th</sup> Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs called for the establishment of a comprehensive strategy in tackling the crisis in Iraq and Syria.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a> The main question remains what should this strategy include?  What more apart from humanitarian aid and Member States’ contributions the EU is able to offer in terms of its foreign policy?

&nbsp;
<ol start="7">
	<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<strong>The Global Coalition to counter ISIL</strong> was created in September 2013, is led by the US and includes sixty partner countries. Coalition partners reaffirmed their commitment to work together under a common, multifaceted, and long-term strategy to degrade and defeat ISIL on December 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2014 while meeting in Brussels. Participants decided that the efforts of the global coalition should focus on multiple lines of effort:
<ol>
	<li>Supporting military operations, capacity building and training;</li>
	<li>Stopping the flow of foreign terrorist fighters;</li>
	<li>Cutting off ISIL's access to financing and funding;</li>
	<li>Addressing associated humanitarian relief and crises;</li>
	<li>Exposing ISIL’s true nature.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<strong>The EU counter-terrorism strategy targeting radical Islamists </strong>includes more stringent controls on EU citizens leaving and entering the Schengen free travel zone, an air passenger registry to check the movement of suspected Islamist militants and fresh cyber-security measures aimed at intercepting suspect traffic, better information sharing for "identification of travel routes of terrorism" and the adoption of  "an EU-wide system for sharing details of air passengers".

&nbsp;

<strong>EUJUST LEX</strong> was a civil crisis management operation implemented under the auspices of the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), which aimed to strengthen the Iraqi criminal justice system. This mission formed part of the EU’s contribution towards the reconstruction and the emergence of a stable, secure and democratic Iraq. EUJUST LEX began on 1 July 2005. The mission was extended a number of times; but the last extension lapsed at the end of 2013.
