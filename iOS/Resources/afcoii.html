	<li><strong> Key terms</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>‘Euroscepticism’</strong> was first used to describe the position of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1986<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>. Since then it has been used to describe a broad variety of negative sentiments relating both to the idea of the European project and the Union in its current form. There are different ways of distinguishing between the types of Euroscepticism; one is hard/soft (Taggart and Szczerbiak, 2002:7) which separates principled opposition to European integration [hard] from qualified opposition in some policy areas [soft].
Kopecky and Muddle (2002) offer a four-part distinction<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Eurorejects</strong> oppose the ideal of integration and the reality of the EU.</li>
	<li><strong>Eurosceptics </strong>support the idea of integration, but not its current realization.</li>
	<li><strong>Europragmatists </strong>do not support integration, but view the EU as useful.</li>
	<li><strong>Euroenthusiasts </strong>support both the ideal of ever-closer union and the EU.
These neat definitions are rarely reflected in the media and general political debate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>Eurosceptic parties – </strong>As with Euroscepticism, different political parties have diverse objections to the European integration and the EU. The link between parties and mass opinion is complex, as research has shown that political elites can help to determine citizens’ attitudes (especially in places where trust in political institutions is relatively high) whilst public opinion can cue parties stances (usually in countries with proportional representation). It is also important to bear in mind that a party’s stance on the EU can be at least partly influenced by strategy, as the public is more likely to be mobilised by protest parties that frame the EU in Eurosceptic terms. One view is that ideology forms broad attitudes towards integration whilst strategy determines a party’s support for the EU’s current path<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>. Others argue that geopolitics also play a role<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>, such as the EFDD group<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> in the European Parliament.</li>

	<li><strong> Relevance and explanation of the issue</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

<em>“When people stand up and talk about the great success that the EU has been, I'm not sure anybody saying it really believes it themselves anymore” – <strong>Nigel Farange, Leader of the UK Indepedence Party </strong></em>

<strong> </strong>

Opposition to the idea of European integration along with criticisms of the current state of integration, and the various policies enacted by the institutions afforded power by the integration process, are as old as the ideas themselves. However in the beginning of the European project, there was much less principled objection to integration. The early days of cooperation relied on the ‘permissive consensus’ of public opinion<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>; voters did not really care what was going on in Brussels. Despite, or perhaps because of, a lack of interest the explicit goal of European integration has remained “an ever closer union”, part of every treaty since the first in 1957<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>.

&nbsp;

This ambivalence turned into relatively broad Euroenthusiasm as member state governments began persuading their citizens of the value of renewed European project. Most of these visions argued that integration would bring economic rewards. Fewer focused on common European values. During this time awareness of the European project increased as the effects of national policies became more apparent. By 1991 over 70% of Europeans on average across the European Community thought that membership was a good thing<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>.

&nbsp;

However as integration became more complicated, with more powers devolved to Brussels and more countries joining in, public opinion began to turn. Member States could no longer rely on passive voters, and public referendums on the state of European integration in France, the Netherlands and Ireland very nearly slammed the brakes on European integration<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>. During the subsequent economic crisis public opinion on the EU fluctuated greatly as the institutions of the EU and European leaders came under great criticism. However, 2014 saw the proportion of Europeans with a positive impression of the EU outnumber neutrals for the first time since 2011 (negative impressions polled last)<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>. In the same year, the European Parliament elections were billed as a massive success for Eurosceptic and anti-austerity parties. Despite intensive media coverage of the election, overall turnout continued its decline<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>. Clearly there is still a great deal of dissatisfaction with the current state and future aims of the European Union.

<strong> </strong>
<ol start="3">
	<li><strong> Key questions</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
	<li>Is the goal of an ever-closer union sustainable?
<ul>
	<li>Is the nature of integration relevant to the concerns of Eurosceptics?</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Is the institutional setup of the EU, or the current policies enacted by the Union, to blame for the rise in Euroscepticism?
<ul>
	<li>Are criticisms of austerity the same as criticisms of the EU/European integration?</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Should the basic structure of EU institutions change, if so how?</li>
	<li>To what extent do Eurosceptic parties represent the genuine concerns of European citizens?</li>
	<li>Are there ways of increasing voter turnout and trust through the policy process rather than institutional reform?</li>
	<li>How is perception of the EU affected by media framing, political communication and political systems?</li>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>
<ol start="4">
	<li><strong> Key facts and figures</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
	<li>Voter turnout in EP elections has declined at every election since the first in 1979, from 62% to 42.5%.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></li>
	<li>Half of European citizens distrust the European Union<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>.</li>
	<li>Perhaps surprisingly, support for the enlargements (usually cited as a major concern of Eurosceptics) in May 2004 and January 2007 was fairly lukewarm<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a> with a majority in favour (46% vs. 42% in 2006)<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>. However, opinion was not evenly split within countries.</li>
	<li>Optimism about the future of the EU is stable and positive, with a clear majority (56%) optimistic<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>.</li>
	<li>The main concern for citizens at the European level remains the economic situation and unemployment, followed by rising worries about immigration<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>.</li>
	<li>72% of citizens feel that ‘what brings the citizens of the different EU Member States together is more important than what separates them’<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></li>
	<li>Opinion is evenly split on the pace of integration; 46% feel that Member States should advance at the same pace, whilst 43% feel Member States should be allowed to advance at different speeds<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>.</li>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>
<ol start="5">
	<li><strong> Key actors</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

<strong>The Institutions of the European Union </strong>are all key actors, as the their relative powers and the way in which the legislative process works may be the source of Euroscepticism. That implies that the <strong>European Commission</strong> as the initiator of legislation and executive body, the <strong>Council of Ministers </strong>and <strong>European Parliament </strong>as equals in decision-making procedure along with the <strong>European Council </strong>(heads of the Member States that set the long term direction of the Union) may all be to blame. The relevance of these actors in relation to <strong>Member State governments </strong>in ensuring what happens at the European level reflects the wishes of the electorate defines the legitimacy of the European Union in the eyes of its citizens. <strong>Eurosceptic parties </strong>are key, as the concerns they represent may be irresolvable at the EU level, or even just down to electoral strategy.

<strong> </strong>
<ol start="6">
	<li><strong> Key conflicts</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

The key conflict is if declining voter turnout, a lack of trust in EU institutions and the rise of Eurosceptic parties calls for a drastic change in the aims of the EU, a change in the way the EU works, or if the current policies of the Union are solely to blame. The causes of, and solutions to, Euroscepticism are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

&nbsp;

<strong>Changing the aims of the EU</strong> means examining if the means of continued cooperation through further integration <em>at different speeds</em> is viable. It might be the case that an ‘ever-closer union’ should no longer be the aim, that that integration should generally proceed at a slower or faster pace, or that Member States should no longer be allowed to integrate at different speeds (thus abandoning ‘<em>differentiated integration’</em>).
<strong>Changing the way the EU works</strong> could mean giving more or less power to the Commission, Parliament, Council of Ministers or European Council respectively. There are also ways to change the legislative process to make it easier for citizens to directly engage with EU decision-making, such as the European Citizen’s Initiative.
<strong>If the current policies of the EU are solely to blame</strong> for Euroscepticism (rather than partly), then the answer may lie in calling for a change in the EU’s stance on austerity. For the Committee on Constitutional Affairs II this implies addressing the way that the EU is framed in the media and by Eurosceptic parties, <em>not </em>proposing specific economic policies. By this logic, reactionary voting to governments might also be linked to Euroscepticism rather than EU policies.

<strong> </strong>
<ol start="7">
	<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

The nature of European integration is enshrined in the treaties of the European Union, agreed on unanimously by the heads of Member States, or by their national parliaments. There are thus no measures in place to change the nature of European integration.

&nbsp;

There have been multiple attempts to change the way the EU works and to increase direct engagement by citizens. The <strong>European Parliament</strong> has been steadily granted new powers since its inception, and is now co-legislator with the Council since the <strong>Lisbon Treaty</strong> in ‘ordinary legislative procedure’<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>. The Lisbon Treaty also introduced the <strong>European Citizen’s Initiative </strong>which allows a minimum of one million citizens from at least seven different countries can call upon the Commission to propose legislation on matters on which the EU has competence (the right) to legislate<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>.

&nbsp;

There are also proposals to change aspects of the EU that are especially criticized by Eurosceptic parties, such removing as the European Parliament’s seat in Strasbourg<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>.
