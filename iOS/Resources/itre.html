	<li><strong> Key terms</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>electrical grid - </strong>An electrical grid is an interconnected network for delivering electricity from suppliers to consumers. It consists of generating stations that produce electrical power, high-voltage transmission lines that carry power from distant sources to demand centers, and distribution lines that connect individual customers<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>renewable energy sources (RES) – </strong>Renewable energy is energy that is derived from natural processes (e.g. sunlight and wind) that are replenished at a higher rate than they are consumed. Solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, bioenergy and ocean power are sources of renewable energy. The role of renewables continues to increase in the electricity, heating and cooling and transport sectors<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>energy mix - </strong>The term energy mix refers to how final energy consumption in a given geographical region breaks down by primary energy source. It includes fossil fuels (oil, natural gas and coal), nuclear energy, waste and the many types of renewable energy (biomass, wind, geothermal, water and solar). These primary energy sources are used to generate electricity, provide fuel for transportation, and heat and cool residential and industrial buildings<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions – </strong>Around 10% of the GHG emitted worldwide in 2012 came from the EU. With measures taken at European level and by Member States at national level, the EU is well on track towards meeting its targets for cutting GHG emissions both under its own internal target in the Europe 2020 Strategy and under the Kyoto Protocol's second commitment period (2013-2020)<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>network codes – </strong>Network codes are sets of rules which apply to one or more parts of the energy sector. The need for them was identified during the course of developing the Third Energy Package<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>. More specifically, Regulation (EC) 714/2009 sets out the areas in which network codes will be developed and a process for developing them<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>.</li>

<em>“I want to reform and reorganise Europe’s energy policy in a new European Energy Union.” – <strong>Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><strong>[7]</strong></a></strong></em>

<em> </em>

Last April, Donald Tusk, then prime minister of Poland and current president of the European Council, launched the idea of a European ‘energy union’ with an article published in the Financial Times<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>. The new European Commission (EC), led by Jean-Claude Juncker, has made creating a European energy union its priority<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> and is expected to publish an official strategy on 25 February<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>. What does a union on energy mean and does it mean the same to everyone?

&nbsp;

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span>

The EU has based its energy policy on the 2006 EC green paper “<em>A European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy”</em>. The strategy introduced three fully balanced, integrated and mutually reinforced pillars; <strong>competitiveness</strong>, <strong>sustainability</strong> and <strong>security</strong>, as the way to reduce costs, GHG emissions and its dependency from Russia, the EU’s major energy trade partner. Along the years, the EU has been trying through numerous legislative and other efforts<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> to ensure competitive prices for its citizens, establish itself as a global leader in the fight against climate change and achieve greater energy independence.

<strong> </strong>

Though, no matter the perspective from which the topic of energy is approached - as a public good, a necessity for economic growth, a demand and supply cycle, a polluting or a geopolitical factor - there is one defining parameter that affects all the above; we are yet to find a cost-effective way to <em>transmit</em> and most importantly <em>store<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><strong>[12]</strong></a></em> electrical energy at a large scale. Consequently, the cost for infrastructural development needed for market integration, the volatility of the RES<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a> and the lack of sufficient energy resources within the EU pose significant challenges when it comes to the future of European energy. In parallel, gas transmission in the form of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) is advancing.

&nbsp;

At the same time, as energy policy is a shared competence between the EU and its Member States<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>, there is great diversification among the latter in terms of energy prices, wholesale electricity and gas market structures and energy mixes, despite the significant steps that have been made already since the 1990s, marking the beginning of the market liberalisation<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>. This diversification is depicted in the Member States’ energy systems functioning as ‘energy islands’; isolated, counterproductive and disadvantaged<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>.

&nbsp;

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The ‘energy union’ idea</span>

The proposal of an ‘energy union’ is not brand new; in 2010 an idea for a ‘European Energy Community’ was proposed by former EC President Jacque Delors and former president of the European Parliament (EP) Jerzy Buzek<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>. Moreover, the announcement of think-big energy plans that are eventually abandoned<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a> is a pattern for newly-appointed EC.

&nbsp;

The Commission has taken a more holistic approach to Tusk’s idea, striping down the strong focus on security to milder/ voluntary mechanism proposals and throwing in vague references to RES and climate. The plan comes with five interlocking dimensions:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Security</strong>: Despite the fact that unlike 2006 and 2009<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a> the Russian-Ukrainian crisis has not given any signs of gas supply dispute, it has “brought security to the forefront”, as the issue of resources is tied with external relations.</li>
	<li><strong>Completion of the internal market</strong>: Following the three Energy Packages<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>, the EC is pushing the idea of cross-border interconnections and fully integrated wholesale and retail energy markets, in order to achieve price convergence and maximise profit.</li>
	<li><strong>Climate</strong>: Having already agreed to the 2030 Climate and Energy Framework<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>, this dimension focuses on energy efficiency of buildings, products and possibly vehicles.</li>
	<li><strong>RES</strong>: The strategy will also include the communication of the EU’s negotiating positions for the United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in Paris 2015<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Research and innovation</strong>: Smart technology, smart energy and smart cities are priorities for building the energy future of Europe, while it seems other technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) are also relegated to this dimension.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

The timing of the strategy<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a> seems ideal; Europe is energy secure for this winter<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>, gas and oil prices are at a historic low level<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a>, possibly allowing for investments in much-needed infrastructure build-up. and the US is having an energy revolution of its own, investing massively in shale gas and oil (‘fracking’)<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>.

&nbsp;

<strong> </strong>
<ol start="3">
	<li><strong> Key questions</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
	<li>Is Juncker’s ‘Energy Union’ a “secret sauce for energy recipe” or simply covering the cracks of the <em>trilemma</em> between sustainability, competitiveness and security without any real bite?</li>
	<li>What role should the Member States as political decision-makers have in international energy affairs?</li>
	<li>Is the diversification of suppliers ensuring in any way energy independence in the long term?</li>
	<li>Whereas wholesale electricity prices declined by one third between 2008 and 2012, should retail prices become a priority beyond tackling ‘energy poverty’?</li>
	<li>Are the climate and energy targets for 2030 a sufficient intermediary step between Europe 2020 and the EU’s Roadmap for moving to a low-carbon economy in 2050<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a>?</li>
	<li>How should the strategy on technologies such as smart grids look like? What further policies need to be adopted in order to ensure a smart, sustainable future?</li>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>
<ol start="4">
	<li><strong> Key facts and figures</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
	<li>Today, the EU imports 53% of the energy it consumes. Energy import dependency relates to crude oil (almost 90%), to natural gas (66%), and to a lesser extent to solid fuels (42%) as well as nuclear fuel (40%).</li>
	<li>The EU external energy bill represents more than €1 billion per day (around €400 billion in 2013) and more than a fifth of total EU imports. The EU imports more than €300 billion of crude oil and oil products, of which one third come directly from Russia<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a>.</li>
	<li>Whilst Europe's energy system would require investments of ca. €1 trillion by 2020, it is estimated that about €200 billion of this investment is needed for electricity and gas networks of European importance alone. €100 billion of this investment should be delivered by the market unaided, whereas the other €100 billion will require public action to leverage the necessary investments<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a>.</li>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>
<ol start="5">
	<li><strong> Key actors</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

The new <strong>EC</strong>, apart from<strong> Directorate-General (DG) for Energy </strong>and the Climate Action and Energy portfolio of Commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete, has also appointed Maroš Šefčovič as its Vice President on Energy Union. The new energy union strategy will naturally follow the Ordinary Legislative Procedure.

&nbsp;

Since the Third Energy Package, the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators – the <strong>Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER)</strong> and the European Networks for Trasmission System Operators<strong> ENTSO-E<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30"><strong>[30]</strong></a> </strong>&amp;<strong> ENTSO-G </strong>have responsibilities over regulation and transmission system operation<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a>.

In the framework of the Organisation for Economic and Cooperation and Development, the <strong>International Energy Agency</strong> operates as a policy advisor for energy to its Member States.

&nbsp;

The <strong>European Trade Union Confederation</strong>, <strong>Eurogas</strong>, representing the interests of the gas industry and the Union of the Electricity Industry, <strong>Eurelectric</strong>, the sector association which represents the common interests of the electricity industry, <strong>Euroheat &amp; Power</strong>, the international association representing the District Heating and Cooling and Combined Heat and Power sector, the <strong>European Wind Energy Association</strong>, as the voice of the wind industry, the <strong>European Photovoltaic Industry Association</strong>, as well as<strong> Foratom, </strong>the trade association for the nuclear energy industry in Europe<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a>.

&nbsp;

The <strong>Green 10</strong>, that are ten of the largest environmental organisations and networks active on the European level and the <strong>European Alliance to Save Energy</strong>.

The EU’s traditional strategic oil and gas suppliers; Russia, Norway, the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Algeria, as well as LNG suppliers.

&nbsp;
<ol start="6">
	<li><strong> Key conflicts</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

A major conflict is that of the definition of energy security. While some countries are fairly independent on Russian gas, others such as Germany having ensured an advantaged negotiating position<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a> and the highly dependent Baltic countries and Poland, it is evident that common ground might be far from any actionable proposal. While one side pushes for enhanced coordination when negotiating prices with Gazprom and solidarity mechanisms in cases of emergency, there is a potential conflict with free market and competition rules.

&nbsp;

At the same time, the different levels of RES market penetration among Member States could potentially hinder the decarbonisation process based on RES schemes<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a> or even the process as a whole, as proposals on shale gas and oil exploitation as well as indigenous coal production are on the table.

&nbsp;

Another legitimate question is whether stronger focus on energy efficiency can result in diversification of suppliers, considering that Europe will remain energy dependent for a long time. Moreover, with a minimal budget allocated for energy infrastructure projects, cost may be the decision-making factor in new projects.

&nbsp;

EU energy security has also to be seen in the context of growing energy demand worldwide, which is expected to increase by 27% by 2030, with important changes to energy supply and trade flows<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a>.

<strong> </strong>
<ol start="7">
	<li><strong> Measures already in place</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

The European legislation addressing the issue of the creation and development of the electricity and gas market is grouped into three different Packages, which were issued in 1996-8, 2003 and 2009 respectively. The 2009/72/ΕC &amp; 2009/73/EC Directives of the EP and of the Council set common rules for the functioning of electricity and gas markets in the EU, as a first step toward a single European energy market (Third Energy Package). The Package covers five main areas<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a>:
<ul>
	<li>unbundling energy suppliers from network operators;</li>
	<li>strengthening the independence of energy regulators;</li>
	<li>establishment of the ACER;</li>
	<li>cross-border cooperation between transmission system operators and the creation of European Networks for Transmission System Operators;</li>
	<li>increased transparency in retail markets to benefit consumers.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

The current EU energy strategy comes under Europe 2020<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a> and the so-called 20-20-20 targets, along with its continuation through the 2030 climate and energy framework. An integral part of the climate strategies is the EU’s Emissions Trading Scheme<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a>.

&nbsp;

The EU has identified a number of priority energy infrastructure projects under its Trans-European Networks (TEN-E) strategy (priority corridors)<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a>. Based on the priority corridors, the EU drew up a list of projects of common interest. It updates this list every two years. The selected projects can take advantage of a number of benefits including faster permitting procedures and applying for funding from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) – the EU's €50 billion plan for boosting energy, transport, and digital infrastructure between 2014 and 2020. €5.85 billion from the CEF amount to energy projects for 2014-2020.

&nbsp;

The vision of an energy-interconnected Europe<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a> is to be carried out by strengthening <strong>cross-border energy trade</strong><a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a> toward price convergence and security of supply. Through the 2030 Climate and Energy Framework, the Member States are asked to ensure a level of electricity interconnections equivalent to or beyond 15% of their installed production capacity.

&nbsp;

However, apart from building large-scale transmission cables and gas pipelines (‘hardware’), the ‘software’ development needed entails harmonising the different tax and regulatory systems among the Member States. As energy taxation varies greatly -mainly due to national subsidy schemes for RES, the EC prioritises regulatory harmonisation, with the development of network codes. As the EC has aligned, national decisions are negatively affecting neighbour interests, a regional approach is needed “even if it is perceived that these decisions must be taken predominantly on a national level”. Main points of conflict are RES subsidy schemes and capacity mechanisms. The EU-wide market rules for full integration- known as the Target Model<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a> – might also need to be revised to reward flexibility and further improve the cost-efficient integration of variable energy into the grid.

&nbsp;

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The energy hardware and software of the future</span>

The RES integration into the energy grid is currently dependent on subsidies, with the cost being passed to the consumers. The promise of the ‘smart grid’<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a> is to enable a new paradigm with a reduced energy cost while getting RES in the game. The challenge is to make this work while maintaining the quality of life; as consumers become also generators; houses are turned into half-households half-industries and the demand side is managed dynamically.
